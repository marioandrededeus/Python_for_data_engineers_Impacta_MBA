abstract = {Advances in automation and autonomous systems means that the future of work will involve even more cognitive effort. For those in already cognitively demanding work, many of us aim to optimise our effort and productivity to achieve more in work, and ideally to rest outside of work. Neuroergonomics research is concerned with how neurotechnology will help improve work to be manageable and safe, often in e.g. safety critical work, operators experience high demands and mental workload. Meanwhile, Neuroethics is concerned with the largely unregulated future of this industry, involving technologies that are not technically medical devices, but will involve invasive forms of personal data. This work aims to explicate the privacy, trust, and ethical concerns that workers have about employers using neurotechnology to manage their work-forces. An online survey and themes drawn from interviews with factory and office workers are presented. We conclude by discussing these concerns and how they might affect the rapidly expanding neurotechnology industry.},

abstract = {Data Videos (DVs), or animated infographics that tell stories with data, are becoming increasingly popular. Despite their potential to induce attitude change, little is explored about how to produce effective DVs. This paper describes two studies that explored factors linked to the potential of health DVs to improve viewers’ behavioural change intentions. We investigated: 1) how viewers’ affect is linked to their behavioural change intentions; 2) how these affect are linked to the viewers’ personality traits; 3) which attributes of DVs are linked to their persuasive potential. Results from both studies indicated that viewers’ negative affect lowered their behavioural change intentions. Individuals with higher neuroticism exhibited higher negative affect and were harder to convince. Finally, Study 2 proved that providing any solutions to the health problem, presented in the DV, made the viewers perceive the videos as more actionable while lowering their negative affect, and importantly, induced higher behavioural change intentions.},

abstract = {Symbiotic simulation systems that incorporate data-driven methods (such as machine/deep learning) are effective and efficient tools for just-in-time (JIT) operational decision making. With the growing interest on Digital Twin City, such systems are ideal for real-time microscopic traffic simulation. However, learning-based models are heavily biased towards the training data and could produce physically inconsistent outputs. In terms of microscopic traffic simulation, this could lead to unsafe driving behaviours causing vehicle collisions in the simulation. As for symbiotic simulation, this could severely affect the performance of real-time base simulation model resulting in inaccurate or unrealistic forecasts, which could, in turn, mislead JIT what-if analysis. To overcome this issue, a physics-guided data-driven modelling paradigm should be adopted so that the resulting model could capture both accurate and safe driving behaviours. However, very few works exist in the development of such a car-following model that can balance between simulation accuracy and physical consistency. Therefore, in this paper, a new “jointly-trained physics-guided Long Short-term Memory (JTPG-LSTM)” neural network, is proposed and integrated to a dynamic data-driven simulation system to capture dynamic car-following behaviours. An extensive set of experiments was conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model from both modelling and simulation perspectives.},

To build such a system, we show how to use an Integer Linear Programming formulation of the pricing problem for a large class of queries, even when pricing is computationally hard. Further, we leverage query history to avoid double charging when queries purchased over time have overlapping information, or when the database is updated. We then present a technique that fairly shares revenue when multiple sellers are involved. Finally, we implement our approach in a prototype and evaluate its performance on several query workloads.},

This study develops a deeper understanding of the circumstances under which crowdsourcing is a useful, feasible or desirable tool for research, as well as the factors that may influence researchers' decisions around adopting crowdsourcing technology. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 researchers in diverse disciplines, spanning the humanities and sciences, to illuminate how research norms and practitioners' dispositions were related to uncertainties around research processes, data, knowledge, delegation and quality.

abstract = {As mobile devices and location-based services become increasingly ubiquitous, the privacy of mobile users' location traces continues to be a major concern. Traditional privacy solutions rely on perturbing each position in a user's trace and replacing it with a fake location. However, recent studies have shown that such point-based perturbation of locations is susceptible to inference attacks and suffers from serious utility losses, because it disregards the moving trajectory and continuity in full location traces. In this paper, we argue that privacy-preserving synthesis of complete location traces can be an effective solution to this problem. We present AdaTrace, a scalable location trace synthesizer with three novel features: provable statistical privacy, deterministic attack resilience, and strong utility preservation. AdaTrace builds a generative model from a given set of real traces through a four-phase synthesis process consisting of feature extraction, synopsis learning, privacy and utility preserving noise injection, and generation of differentially private synthetic location traces. The output traces crafted by AdaTrace preserve utility-critical information existing in real traces, and are robust against known location trace attacks. We validate the effectiveness of AdaTrace by comparing it with three state of the art approaches (ngram, DPT, and SGLT) using real location trace datasets (Geolife and Taxi) as well as a simulated dataset of 50,000 vehicles in Oldenburg, Germany. AdaTrace offers up to 3-fold improvement in trajectory utility, and is orders of magnitude faster than previous work, while preserving differential privacy and attack resilience.},

abstract = {Monitoring of in-person conversations has largely been done using acoustic sensors. In this paper, we propose a new method to detect moment-by-moment conversation episodes by analyzing breathing patterns captured by a mobile respiration sensor. Since breathing is affected by physical and cognitive activities, we develop a comprehensive method for cleaning, screening, and analyzing noisy respiration data captured in the field environment at individual breath cycle level. Using training data collected from a speech dynamics lab study with 12 participants, we show that our algorithm can identify each respiration cycle with 96.34% accuracy even in presence of walking. We present a Conditional Random Field, Context-Free Grammar (CRF-CFG) based conversation model, called rConverse, to classify respiration cycles into speech or non-speech, and subsequently infer conversation episodes. Our model achieves 82.7% accuracy for speech/non-speech classification and it identifies conversation episodes with 95.9% accuracy on lab data using a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. Finally, the system is validated against audio ground-truth in a field study with 32 participants. rConverse identifies conversation episodes with 71.7% accuracy on 254 hours of field data. For comparison, the accuracy from a high-quality audio-recorder on the same data is 71.9%.},

abstract = {Holistic medical multimedia systems covering end-to-end functionality from data collection to aided diagnosis are highly needed, but rare. In many hospitals, the potential value of multimedia data collected through routine examinations is not recognized. Moreover, the availability of the data is limited, as the health care personnel may not have direct access to stored data. However, medical specialists interact with multimedia content daily through their everyday work and have an increasing interest in finding ways to use it to facilitate their work processes. In this article, we present a novel, holistic multimedia system aiming to tackle automatic analysis of video from gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. The proposed system comprises the whole pipeline, including data collection, processing, analysis, and visualization. It combines filters using machine learning, image recognition, and extraction of global and local image features. The novelty is primarily in this holistic approach and its real-time performance, where we automate a complete algorithmic GI screening process. We built the system in a modular way to make it easily extendable to analyze various abnormalities, and we made it efficient in order to run in real time. The conducted experimental evaluation proves that the detection and localization accuracy are comparable or even better than existing systems, but it is by far leading in terms of real-time performance and efficient resource consumption.},

In this paper, we present a survey of the state of the art on schema information extraction approaches. We analyze and classify these approaches into three families: (1) approaches that exploit the implicit structure of the data, without assuming that some explicit statements on the schema are provided in the dataset; (2) approaches that use the explicit schema statements contained in the dataset to complement and enrich the schema, and (3) those that discover structural patterns contained in a dataset. We compare these studies in terms of their approach, advantages and limitations. Finally we discuss the problems that remain open.},

Unlike in-lab studies, however, online experiments often fail to inform participants about the research to which they contribute. This paper is the first to investigate barriers that prevent researchers from providing such science communication in online experiments. We found that the main obstacles preventing researchers from including such information are assumptions about participant disinterest, limited time, concerns about losing anonymity, and concerns about experimental bias. Researchers also noted the dearth of tools to help them close the information loop with their study participants. Based on these findings, we formulated design requirements and implemented Digestif, a new web-based tool that supports researchers in providing their participants with science communication pages. Our evaluation shows that Digestif's scaffolding, examples, and nudges to focus on participants make researchers more aware of their participants' curiosity about research and more likely to disclose pertinent research information.},

This year's conference is being held in the beautiful cultural capital of Australia, Melbourne. During the Gold Rush period of the 19th Century, Melbourne was the richest city in the world, and as a result it is filled with many unique neighborhoods and distinctive buildings. In addition to wonderful neighborhoods to explore, the city has great museums and other cultural attractions, as well as a fine multi-cultural atmosphere. For those who would like to explore the outdoors, popular highlights are the Phillip Island Nature Park (90 minutes away), which features wild penguins who return in a parade each day at sunset, and the Great Ocean Road, one of the world's most scenic coastal drives, including the famous towering 12 Apostles.SIGMOD 2015's exciting technical program reflects not only traditional topics, but the database community's role in broader data science and data analytics. The keynote from Laura Haas, "The Power Behind the Throne: Information Integration in the Age of Data-Driven Discovery" highlights the role of database and data integration techniques in the growing field of data science. Jignesh Patel's talk, "From Data to Insights @ Bare Metal Speed," explains how hardware and software need to be co-evolved to support the needs of scalable data analytics. Jennifer Widom, winner of the 2015 ACM-W Athena Lecturer Award for fundamental contributions to computer science, will give her award talk, "Three Favorite Results," on Tuesday. Christopher R\'{e} will lead a panel on "Machine Learning and Databases: The Sound of Things to Come or a Cacophony of Hype?," with participants Divyakant Agrawal, Magdalena Balazinska, Michael Cafarella, Michael Jordan, Tim Kraska, and Raghu Ramakrishnan. Of course, there are also 106 research paper presentations, 4 tutorials, 30 demonstrations, and 18 industrial papers. Papers will be presented both as talks during the research sessions, and as part of plenary Poster Sessions.SIGMOD 2015 is preceded by the PhD Workshop, as well as workshops on leading-edge topics like data analytics (DanaC), databases and the Web (WebDB), exploratory search (ExploreDB), managing and mining spatial data (GeoRich), and graph data (GRADES); the New Researcher Symposium will take place on Wednesday. The banquet will be held in a Melbourne landmark, the Town Hall.As in recent years, we had two submission deadlines for SIGMOD this year, one in August and one in November. The review process was journal-style, with multiple rounds of reviews coordinated by the Group Leaders. We accepted 34 of 137 papers from the first deadline and 72 of 278 from the second deadline. The total acceptance rate was about 25.5%, and we believe that the revision processhas improved the quality of the technical program.},

Research explores different approaches to improve ML dependability by proposing new models and training techniques to reduce generalization error, achieve domain adaptation, and detect outlier examples and adversarial attacks. However, there is a missing connection between ongoing ML research and well-established safety principles. In this paper, we present a structured and comprehensive review of ML techniques to improve the dependability of ML algorithms in uncontrolled open-world settings. From this review, we propose the Taxonomy of ML Safety that maps state-of-the-art ML techniques to key engineering safety strategies. Our taxonomy of ML safety presents a safety-oriented categorization of ML techniques to provide guidance for improving dependability of the ML design and development. The proposed taxonomy can serve as a safety checklist to aid designers in improving coverage and diversity of safety strategies employed in any given ML system.},

Qualitative data from respondents of both these groups show that the concerns are mostly similar. However, the factors perceived to alleviate privacy concerns are more varied and nuanced amongst those who have obtained a DTC genetic test. Our data suggest that privacy concerns or lack of concerns are based on complex and multiple considerations including data ownership, access control of data and regulatory authorities of social, political and legal systems.

We revise the chase for GEDs and prove its Church-Rosser property. We characterize GED satisfiability and implication, and establish the complexity of these problems and the validation problem for GEDs, in the presence and absence of constant literals and id literals. We also develop a sound, complete and independent axiom system for finite implication of GEDs. In addition, we extend GEDs with built-in predicates or disjunctions, to strike a balance between the expressive power and complexity.

An automatic summarization system that can effectively condense long documents into short and concise texts to encapsulate the most important information would thus be significant in aiding the reader’s comprehension. Recently, with the advent of neural architectures, significant research efforts have been made to advance automatic text summarization systems, and numerous studies on the challenges of extending these systems to the long document domain have emerged. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the research on long document summarization and a systematic evaluation across the three principal components of its research setting: benchmark datasets, summarization models, and evaluation metrics. For each component, we organize the literature within the context of long document summarization and conduct an empirical analysis to broaden the perspective on current research progress. The empirical analysis includes a study on the intrinsic characteristics of benchmark datasets, a multi-dimensional analysis of summarization models, and a review of the summarization evaluation metrics. Based on the overall findings, we conclude by proposing possible directions for future exploration in this rapidly growing field.},

abstract = {Populating a database with information from unstructured sources--also known as knowledge base construction (KBC)--is a long-standing problem in industry and research that encompasses problems of extraction, cleaning, and integration. In this work, we describe DeepDive, a system that combines database and machine learning ideas to help develop KBC systems, and we present techniques to make the KBC process more efficient. We observe that the KBC process is iterative, and we develop techniques to incrementally produce inference results for KBC systems. We propose two methods for incremental inference, based, respectively, on sampling and variational techniques. We also study the trade-off space of these methods and develop a simple rule-based optimizer. DeepDive includes all of these contributions, and we evaluate DeepDive on five KBC systems, showing that it can speed up KBC inference tasks by up to two orders of magnitude with negligible impact on quality.},

EVE uses an interactive evolutionary algorithm to steer the exploration of multidimensional data sets toward two-dimensional projections that are interesting to the analyst. Our method smoothly combines automatically calculated metrics and user input in order to propose pertinent views to the user. In this article, we revisit this framework and a prototype application that was developed as a demonstrator, and summarise our previous study with domain experts and its main findings. We then report on results from a new user study with a clearly predefined task, which examines how users leverage the system and how the system evolves to match their needs. While we previously showed that using EVE, domain experts were able to formulate interesting hypotheses and reach new insights when exploring freely, our new findings indicate that users, guided by the interactive evolutionary algorithm, are able to converge quickly to an interesting view of their data when a clear task is specified. We provide a detailed analysis of how users interact with an evolutionary algorithm and how the system responds to their exploration strategies and evaluation patterns. Our work aims at building a bridge between the domains of visual analytics and interactive evolution. The benefits are numerous, in particular for evaluating interactive evolutionary computation IEC techniques based on user study methodologies.},

The deployment and applications of IoT range from smart cities to urban computing and from ubiquitous healthcare to tactile Internet. For this reason, the physical infrastructure of heterogeneous network systems has become more complicated and thus requires efficient and dynamic solutions for management, configuration, and flow scheduling. Network softwarization in the form of Software Defined Networks and Network Function Virtualization has been extensively researched for IoT in the recent past. In this article, we present a systematic and comprehensive review of virtualization techniques explicitly designed for IoT networks. We have classified the literature into software-defined networks designed for IoT, function virtualization for IoT networks, and software-defined IoT networks. These categories are further divided into works that present architectural, security, and management solutions. Besides, the article highlights several short-term and long-term research challenges and open issues related to the adoption of software-defined Internet of Things.},

Many “corona apps” require widespread adoption to be effective, which has sparked public debates about the privacy, security, and societal implications of government-backed health applications. We conducted a representative online study in Germany (n = 1003), the US (n = 1003), and China (n = 1019) to investigate user acceptance of corona apps, using a vignette design based on the contextual integrity framework. We explored apps for contact tracing, symptom checks, quarantine enforcement, health certificates, and mere information. Our results provide insights into data processing practices that foster adoption and reveal significant differences between countries, with user acceptance being highest in China and lowest in the US. Chinese participants prefer the collection of personalized data, while German and US participants favor anonymity. Across countries, contact tracing is viewed more positively than quarantine enforcement, and technical malfunctions negatively impact user acceptance.},

abstract = {Missing value (MV) imputation is a critical preprocessing means for data mining. Nevertheless, existing MV imputation methods are mostly designed for batch processing, and thus are not applicable to streaming data, especially those with poor quality. In this article, we propose a framework, called Real-time and Error-tolerant Missing vAlue ImputatioN (REMAIN), to impute MVs in poor-quality streaming data. Instead of imputing MVs based on all the observed data, REMAIN first initializes the MV imputation model based on a-RANSAC which is capable of detecting and rejecting anomalies in an efficient manner, and then incrementally updates the model parameters upon the arrival of new data to support real-time MV imputation. As the correlations among attributes of the data may change over time in unforseenable ways, we devise a deterioration detection mechanism to capture the deterioration of the imputation model to further improve the imputation accuracy. Finally, we conduct an extensive evaluation on the proposed algorithms using real-world and synthetic datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that REMAIN achieves significantly higher imputation accuracy over existing solutions. Meanwhile, REMAIN improves up to one order of magnitude in time cost compared with existing approaches.},

abstract = {Scripts are widely used to design and run scientific experiments. Scripting languages are easy to learn and use, and they allow complex tasks to be specified and executed in fewer steps than with traditional programming languages. However, they also have important limitations for reproducibility and data management. As experiments are iteratively refined, it is challenging to reason about each experiment run (or trial), to keep track of the association between trials and experiment instances as well as the differences across trials, and to connect results to specific input data and parameters. Approaches have been proposed that address these limitations by collecting, managing, and analyzing the provenance of scripts. In this article, we survey the state of the art in provenance for scripts. We have identified the approaches by following an exhaustive protocol of forward and backward literature snowballing. Based on a detailed study, we propose a taxonomy and classify the approaches using this taxonomy.},

abstract = {With the booming popularity of online social networks like Twitter and Weibo, online user footprints are accumulating rapidly on the social web. Simultaneously, the question of how to leverage the large-scale user-generated social media data for personal credit scoring comes into the sight of both researchers and practitioners. It has also become a topic of great importance and growing interest in the P2P lending industry. However, compared with traditional financial data, heterogeneous social data presents both opportunities and challenges for personal credit scoring. In this article, we seek a deep understanding of how to learn users’ credit labels from social data in a comprehensive and efficient way. Particularly, we explore the social-data-based credit scoring problem under the micro-blogging setting for its open, simple, and real-time nature. To identify credit-related evidence hidden in social data, we choose to conduct an analytical and empirical study on a large-scale dataset from Weibo, the largest and most popular tweet-style website in China. Summarizing results from existing credit scoring literature, we first propose three social-data-based credit scoring principles as guidelines for in-depth exploration. In addition, we glean six credit-related insights arising from empirical observations of the testbed dataset. Based on the proposed principles and insights, we extract prediction features mainly from three categories of users’ social data, including demographics, tweets, and networks. To harness this broad range of features, we put forward a two-tier stacking and boosting enhanced ensemble learning framework. Quantitative investigation of the extracted features shows that online social media data does have good potential in discriminating good credit users from bad. Furthermore, we perform experiments on the real-world Weibo dataset consisting of more than 7.3 million tweets and 200,000 users whose credit labels are known through our third-party partner. Experimental results show that (i) our approach achieves a roughly 0.625 AUC value with all the proposed social features as input, and (ii) our learning algorithm can outperform traditional credit scoring methods by as much as 17% for social-data-based personal credit scoring.},

In this work, we create a true Many-to-Many multilingual translation model that can translate directly between any pair of 100 languages. We build and open-source a training data set that covers thousands of language directions with parallel data, created through large-scale mining. Then, we explore how to effectively increase model capacity through a combination of dense scaling and language-specific sparse parameters to create high quality models. Our focus on non-English-Centric models brings gains of more than 10 BLEU when directly translating between non-English directions while performing competitively to the best single systems from the Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT). We open-source our scripts so that others may reproduce the data, evaluation, and final M2M- 100 model},

abstract = {Dimensionality reduction is a commonly used technique in data analytics. Reducing the dimensionality of datasets helps not only with managing their analytical complexity but also with removing redundancy. Over the years, several such algorithms have been proposed with their aims ranging from generating simple linear projections to complex non-linear transformations of the input data. Subsequently, researchers have defined several quality metrics in order to evaluate the performances of different algorithms. Hence, given a plethora of dimensionality reduction algorithms and metrics for their quality analysis, there is a long-existing need for guidelines on how to select the most appropriate algorithm in a given scenario. In order to bridge this gap, in this article, we have compiled 12 state-of-the-art quality metrics and categorized them into 5 identified analytical contexts. Furthermore, we assessed 15 most popular dimensionality reduction algorithms on the chosen quality metrics using a large-scale and systematic experimental study. Later, using a set of robust non-parametric statistical tests, we assessed the generalizability of our evaluation on 40 real-world datasets. Finally, based on our results, we present practitioners’ guidelines for the selection of an appropriate dimensionally reduction algorithm in the present analytical contexts.},

Moreover, we show that GFD discovery is feasible over large-scale graphs, by providing parallel scalable algorithms that guarantee to reduce running time when more processors are used.

abstract = {Intelligent Computing for Interactive System Design provides a comprehensive resource on what has become the dominant paradigm in designing novel interaction methods, involving gestures, speech, text, touch and brain-controlled interaction, embedded in innovative and emerging human–computer interfaces. These interfaces support ubiquitous interaction with applications and services running on smartphones, wearables, in-vehicle systems, virtual and augmented reality, robotic systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), and many other domains that are now highly competitive, both in commercial and in research contexts.This book presents the crucial theoretical foundations needed by any student, researcher, or practitioner working on novel interface design, with chapters on statistical methods, digital signal processing (DSP), and machine learning (ML). These foundations are followed by chapters that discuss case studies on smart cities, brain–computer interfaces, probabilistic mobile text entry, secure gestures, personal context from mobile phones, adaptive touch interfaces, and automotive user interfaces. The case studies chapters also highlight an in-depth look at the practical application of DSP and ML methods used for processing of touch, gesture, biometric, or embedded sensor inputs. A common theme throughout the case studies is ubiquitous support for humans in their daily professional or personal activities.In addition, the book provides walk-through examples of different DSP and ML techniques and their use in interactive systems. Common terms are defined, and information on practical resources is provided (e.g., software tools, data resources) for hands-on project work to develop and evaluate multimodal and multi-sensor systems. In a series of short additions to each chapter, an expert on the legal and ethical issues explores the emergent deep concerns of the professional community, on how DSP and ML should be adopted and used in socially appropriate ways, to most effectively advance human performance during ubiquitous interaction with omnipresent computers.This carefully edited collection is written by international experts and pioneers in the fields of DSP and ML. It provides a textbook for students and a reference and technology roadmap for developers and professionals working on interaction design on emerging platforms.}

These techniques assume implicitly that the training program is bug-free and appropriately configured. However, satisfying this assumption for a novel problem requires significant engineering work to prepare the data, design the DNN, implement the training program, and tune the hyperparameters in order to produce the model for which current automated test data generators search for corner-case behaviors. All these model training steps can be error-prone. Therefore, it is crucial to detect and correct errors throughout all the engineering steps of DNN-based software systems and not only on the resulting DNN model. In this paper, we gather a catalog of training issues and based on their symptoms and their effects on the behavior of the training program, we propose practical verification routines to detect the aforementioned issues, automatically, by continuously validating that some important properties of the learning dynamics hold during the training. Then, we design, TheDeepChecker, an end-to-end property-based debugging approach for DNN training programs and implement it as a TensorFlow-based library. As an empirical evaluation, we conduct a case study to assess the effectiveness of TheDeepChecker on synthetic and real-world buggy DL programs and compare its performance to that of the Amazon SageMaker Debugger (SMD). Results show that TheDeepChecker’s on-execution validation of DNN-based program’s properties through three sequential phases (pre-, on-, and post-fitting), succeeds in revealing several coding bugs and system misconfigurations errors, early on and at a low cost. Moreover, our property-based approach outperforms the SMD’s offline rules verification on training logs in terms of detection accuracy for unstable learning issues and coverage of additional DL bugs.},

abstract = {Welcome to CSCW 2017, the ACM 2017 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing! We are excited to welcome the CSCW community back to Portland, Oregon, where the second CSCW conference was held in 1988. Both Portland and CSCW have matured a great deal during the intervening 29 years. We hope that you will find that Portland provides a stimulating environment for our conference.CSCW is the premier venue for presenting research in the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and networks. Bringing together top researchers and practitioners from academia and industry, CSCW explores the technical, social, material, and theoretical challenges of designing technology to support collaborative work and life activities. CSCW welcomes a diverse range of topics and research methodologies. Studies often involve the development and application of novel technologies and/or ethnographic studies that inform design practice or theory. The mission of the conference is to share research that advances the state of human knowledge and improves both the design of systems and the ways they are used. The diversity of work in our conference program reflects the diversity of technology use in people's work, social, and civic lives as well as the geographic and cultural diversity of contributors.As many of you know, CSCW follows a rigorous "revise and resubmit" review process that uses peer review to improve submitted papers while maintaining a high-quality threshold for final acceptance. We also help prepare the next generation of reviewers with a mentorship program in which students review papers under the guidance of an experienced reviewer. This year we have the largest CSCW program ever. We had 530 submitted papers and 183 were accepted for presentation at the conference. The program also includes 4 papers published in ACM Transactions on Human- Computer Interaction (TOCHI). In addition, we will feature 14 workshops, 56 posters, 12 demos, and 3 panels.Lili Cheng of Microsoft Research will open the conference, speaking on "Conversational AI &amp; Lessons Learned." Our closing plenary will feature Jorge Cham, the creator of PhD Comics, who will talk about, "The Science Gap." We also welcome Paul Luff and Christian Heath from King's College as the recipients of this year's CSCW Lasting Impact award for their influential 1998 paper, "Mobility in Collaboration."},

abstract = {The Handbook of Multimodal-Multisensor Interfaces provides the first authoritative resource on what has become the dominant paradigm for new computer interfaces-user input involving new media (speech, multi-touch, gestures, writing) embedded in multimodal-multisensor interfaces. These interfaces support smartphones, wearables, in-vehicle, robotic, and many other applications that are now highly competitive commercially. This edited collection is written by international experts and pioneers in the field. It provides a textbook for students, and a reference and technology roadmap for professionals working in this rapidly emerging area. Volume 1 of the handbook presents relevant theory and neuroscience foundations for guiding the development of high-performance systems. Additional chapters discuss approaches to user modeling, interface design that supports user choice, synergistic combination of modalities with sensors, and blending of multimodal input and output. They also highlight an in-depth look at the most common multimodal-multisensor combinations- for example, touch and pen input, haptic and non-speech audio output, and speech co-processed with visible lip movements, gaze, gestures, or pen input. A common theme throughout is support for mobility and individual differences among users-including the world's rapidly growing population of seniors. These handbook chapters provide walk-through examples and video illustrations of different system designs and their interactive use. Common terms are defined, and information on practical resources is provided (e.g., software tools, data resources) for hands-on project work to develop and evaluate multimodal-multisensor systems. In the final chapter, experts exchange views on a timely and controversial challenge topic, and how they believe multimodal-multisensor interfaces should be designed in the future to most effectively advance human performance.}
