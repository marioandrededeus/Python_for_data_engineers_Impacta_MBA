abstract = {Given the global increase in crippling cyberattacks, organizations are increasingly turning to cyberthreat intelligence (CTI). CTI represents actionable threat information that is relevant to a specific organization and that thus demands its close attention. CTI efforts aim to help organizations “know their enemies better” for proactive, preventive, and timely threat detection and remediation—complementing conventional risk-management paradigms designed to improve ‘general readiness’ against known or unknown threats. Organizational security (OrgSec) and behavioral security research has lagged behind CTI's growing potential to address current cybersecurity challenges. Instead, CTI has largely been the purview of computer science from an algorithmic perspective. However, OrgSec and behavioral researchers can contribute a further combined knowledge of design for the organization, human factors, and organizational governance to foster CTI. In this theory-building and review manuscript, we propose the CTI capability model (CTI-CM) to prescribe the key capabilities necessary for a CTI practitioner to engage effectively in CTI activities. The CTI-CM defines a practitioner's CTI capability in terms of three highly interrelated but conceptually distinctive dimensions: analytical component capability, contextual response capability, and experiential practice capability. We further explain how these capabilities can be fostered, and the key implications for leading security practice in organizations.}

Specifically, past trading activities by individual (institutional) investors have significantly affected the current trading behaviors and strategies of individual investors (both investor types). Furthermore, retail (institutional) investors are most likely to perform contrarian (momentum) strategies and trade frequently (infrequently) with small (large) amounts of money and short (long) holding periods.}

abstract = {It has been proven that advanced building control, like model predictive control (MPC), can notably reduce the energy use and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. However, despite intensive research efforts, the practical applications are still in the early stages. There is a growing need for multidisciplinary education on advanced control methods in the built environment to be accessible for a broad range of researchers and practitioners with different engineering backgrounds. This paper provides a unified framework for model predictive building control technology with focus on the real-world applications. From a theoretical point of view, this paper presents an overview of MPC formulations for building control, modeling paradigms and model types, together with algorithms necessary for real-life implementation. The paper categorizes the most notable MPC problem classes, links them with corresponding solution techniques, and provides an overview of methods for mitigation of the uncertainties for increased performance and robustness of MPC. From a practical point of view, this paper delivers an elaborate classification of the most important modeling, co-simulation, optimal control design, and optimization techniques, tools, and solvers suitable to tackle the MPC problems in the context of building climate control. On top of this, the paper presents the essential components of a practical implementation of MPC such as different control architectures and nuances of communication infrastructures within supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. The paper draws practical guidelines with a generic workflow for implementation of MPC in real buildings aimed for contemporary adopters of this technology. Finally, the importance of standardized performance assessment and methodology for comparison of different building control algorithms is discussed.}

Benefiting from the advances of network science and high-throughput biomedical technologies, studying the biological systems from network biology has attracted much attention in recent years, and networks have long been central to our understanding of biological systems, in the form of linkage maps among genotypes, phenotypes, and the corresponding environmental factors. In this review, we summarize the recent developments of computational network biology, first introducing various types of biological networks and network structural properties. We then review the network-based approaches, ranging from some network metrics to the complicated machine-learning methods, and emphasize how to use these algorithms to gain new biological insights. Furthermore, we highlight the application in neuroscience, human disease, and drug developments from the perspectives of network science, and we discuss some major challenges and future directions. We hope that this review will draw increasing interdisciplinary attention from physicists, computer scientists, and biologists.}

abstract = {In recent years, the wealth of technological development revolutionised our ability to collect data in geosciences. Due to the unprecedented level of detail of these datasets, geomorphologists are facing new challenges, giving more in-depth answers to a broad(er) range of fundamental questions across the full spectrum of the Earth's (and Planetary) processes. This contribution builds on the existing literature of geomorphometry (the science of quantitative land-surface analysis) and feature extraction (translate land surface parameters into extents of geomorphological elements). It provides evidence of critical themes as well as emerging fields of future research in the digital realm, supporting the likely effectiveness of geomorphometry and feature extractions as they are advancing the theoretical, empirical and applied dimension of geomorphology. The review further discusses the role of geomorphometric legacies, and scientific reproducibility, and how they can be implemented, in the hope that this will facilitate action towards improving the transparency, and efficiency of scientific research, and accelerate discoveries in geomorphology. In the current landscape, substantial changes in landforms, ecosystems, land use, hydrological routing, and direct anthropogenic modifications impact systems across the full spectrum of geomorphological processes. Although uncertainties in the precise nature and likelihood of changes exist, geomorphometry and feature extraction can aid exploring process regimes and landscape responses. Taken together, they can revolutionise geomorphology by opening the doors to improved investigations crossing space and time scales, blurring the boundaries between traditional approaches and computer modelling, and facilitating cross-disciplinary research. Ultimately, the exploitation of the available wealth of digital information can help to translate our understanding of geomorphic processes, which is often based on observations of past or current conditions, into the rapidly changing future.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Oral rehydration solution (ORS) is a form of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) for diarrhoea that has the potential to drastically reduce child mortality; yet, according to UNICEF estimates, less than half of children younger than 5 years with diarrhoea in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) received ORS in 2016. A variety of recommended home fluids (RHF) exist as alternative forms of ORT; however, it is unclear whether RHF prevent child mortality. Previous studies have shown considerable variation between countries in ORS and RHF use, but subnational variation is unknown. This study aims to produce high-resolution geospatial estimates of relative and absolute coverage of ORS, RHF, and ORT (use of either ORS or RHF) in LMICs.
Methods
We used a Bayesian geostatistical model including 15 spatial covariates and data from 385 household surveys across 94 LMICs to estimate annual proportions of children younger than 5 years of age with diarrhoea who received ORS or RHF (or both) on continuous continent-wide surfaces in 2000–17, and aggregated results to policy-relevant administrative units. Additionally, we analysed geographical inequality in coverage across administrative units and estimated the number of diarrhoeal deaths averted by increased coverage over the study period. Uncertainty in the mean coverage estimates was calculated by taking 250 draws from the posterior joint distribution of the model and creating uncertainty intervals (UIs) with the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles of those 250 draws.
Findings
While ORS use among children with diarrhoea increased in some countries from 2000 to 2017, coverage remained below 50% in the majority (62·6%; 12 417 of 19 823) of second administrative-level units and an estimated 6 519 000 children (95% UI 5 254 000–7 733 000) with diarrhoea were not treated with any form of ORT in 2017. Increases in ORS use corresponded with declines in RHF in many locations, resulting in relatively constant overall ORT coverage from 2000 to 2017. Although ORS was uniformly distributed subnationally in some countries, within-country geographical inequalities persisted in others; 11 countries had at least a 50% difference in one of their units compared with the country mean. Increases in ORS use over time were correlated with declines in RHF use and in diarrhoeal mortality in many locations, and an estimated 52 230 diarrhoeal deaths (36 910–68 860) were averted by scaling up of ORS coverage between 2000 and 2017. Finally, we identified key subnational areas in Colombia, Nigeria, and Sudan as examples of where diarrhoeal mortality remains higher than average, while ORS coverage remains lower than average.
Interpretation
To our knowledge, this study is the first to produce and map subnational estimates of ORS, RHF, and ORT coverage and attributable child diarrhoeal deaths across LMICs from 2000 to 2017, allowing for tracking progress over time. Our novel results, combined with detailed subnational estimates of diarrhoeal morbidity and mortality, can support subnational needs assessments aimed at furthering policy makers' understanding of within-country disparities. Over 50 years after the discovery that led to this simple, cheap, and life-saving therapy, large gains in reducing mortality could still be made by reducing geographical inequalities in ORS coverage.

abstract = {In its traditional definition, a repair of an inconsistent database is a consistent database that differs from the inconsistent one in a “minimal way.” Often, repairs are not equally legitimate, as it is desired to prefer one over another; for example, one fact is regarded more reliable than another, or a more recent fact should be preferred to an earlier one. Motivated by these considerations, researchers have introduced and investigated the framework of preferred repairs, in the context of denial constraints and subset repairs. There, a priority relation between facts is lifted towards a priority relation between consistent databases, and repairs are restricted to the ones that are optimal in the lifted sense. Three notions of lifting (and preferred repairs) have been proposed: Pareto, global, and completion. In this article, we investigate the complexity of three problems on preferred repairs. The first is the problem of deciding whether the priority relation contains enough information to clean the database unambiguously, or in other words, whether there is exactly one preferred repair. We show that the different lifting semantics entail highly different complexities for this problem. Then, we study the ability to quantify ambiguity, by investigating two classes of problems. The first is that of counting the preferred repairs. We establish a dichotomy in data complexity for the entire space of (sets of) functional dependencies for all three notions. The second class of problems is that of enumerating (i.e., generating) the preferred repairs. We devise enumeration algorithms with efficiency guarantees on the delay between generated repairs, even for constraints represented as general conflict graphs or hypergraphs.}

Decision support is therefore a core concern. As decision support is actually about making the right decisions and undertaking the right action, it relates to precise functions. From these functions, three themes can be identified, which are developed in this chapter. The first theme concerns building information that can support decisions from spatial data. This includes defining the decision to be supported, including spatial scaling matters, identifying the knowledge management paradigm, the timeliness of decision and action and the criteria involved. The second theme is about optimization and planning. It includes concepts and methods that can be related to decisions taken during the nonproduction periods, such as strategical enterprise objectives and choices of tactics, as well as to decisions taken during the production cycle, which can be simple scheduling of operations or more complex choices aimed at adapting crop management to the specific characteristics of a given year. The third theme is about designing an information system for smart farming. This includes considering the production processes and making models of these and the general framework for design. It also includes elements related to implementation of proposed next-generation databases.}

They are even being tested in safety-critical systems, thanks to recent breakthroughs in deep learning and reinforcement learning. Many people are now interacting with systems based on ML every day, e.g., voice recognition systems used by virtual personal assistants like Amazon Alexa or Google Home. As the field of ML continues to grow, we are likely to witness transformative advances in a wide range of areas, from finance, energy, to health and transportation. Given this growing importance of ML-based systems in our daily life, it is becoming utterly important to ensure their reliability. Recently, software researchers have started adapting concepts from the software testing domain (e.g., code coverage, mutation testing, or property-based testing) to help ML engineers detect and correct faults in ML programs. This paper reviews current existing testing practices for ML programs. First, we identify and explain challenges that should be addressed when testing ML programs. Next, we report existing solutions found in the literature for testing ML programs. Finally, we identify gaps in the literature related to the testing of ML programs and make recommendations of future research directions for the scientific community. We hope that this comprehensive review of software testing practices will help ML engineers identify the right approach to improve the reliability of their ML-based systems. We also hope that the research community will act on our proposed research directions to advance the state of the art of testing for ML programs.}

abstract = {Data provenance is a structured form of metadata designed to record the activities and datasets involved in data production, as well as their dependency relationships. The PROV data model, released by the W3C in 2013, defines a schema and constraints that together provide a structural and semantic foundation for provenance. This enables the interoperable exchange of provenance between data producers and consumers. When the provenance content is sensitive and subject to disclosure restrictions, however, a way of hiding parts of the provenance in a principled way before communicating it to certain parties is required. In this paper we present a provenance abstraction operator that achieves this goal. It maps a graphical representation of a PROV document PG1 to a new abstract version PG2, ensuring that (i) PG2 is a valid PROV graph, and (ii) the dependencies that appear in PG2 are justified by those that appear in PG1. These two properties ensure that further abstraction of abstract PROV graphs is possible. A guiding principle of the work is that of minimum damage: the resultant graph is altered as little as possible, while ensuring that the two properties are maintained. The operator developed is implemented as part of a user tool, described in a separate paper, that lets owners of sensitive provenance information control the abstraction by specifying an abstraction policy.}

abstract = {Leak detection in pipelines has been a prevalent issue for several decades. Pipeline leaks from sources such as small cracks and pinholes are termed chronic leaks, as they have the potential of going unnoticed for long time periods, causing both economic losses and environmental damage. Literature lacks a comprehensive review of chronic leaks, especially under subsea or arctic conditions. Therefore, a primary objective of this work was the critical analysis of the current state of leak detection technology, especially under these conditions. A summary of critical findings from both experimental and field studies is included. A secondary goal was to determine the leak detection accuracy, resource level requirements, and risk of installation and operation for various techniques. The analysis shows medium to large scale leaks between 3 and 10 mm can be detected using dynamic pressure wave monitoring for single phase flow, whereas sequential probability ratio testing (SPRT) using real time transient monitoring (RTTM) can be used to monitor leaks for multiphase flow even in shallow water conditions and along elevated pipeline networks. Vacuum annulus monitoring arrangements can be utilized in order to detect chronic leaks, but are limited in their application due to weight and difficulty of pipeline installation. Additionally, distributed temperature sensing (DTS) and distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) leak detection using fiber optic cables (FOC) was found to be resource intensive and have higher installation cost and operational risks due to unknown equipment reliability and location or sealing of the FOC on the pipeline structure. SPRT using RTTM have comparable accuracy to DTS or DAS leak detection and can be retrofitted to existing pipeline networks. However, more pilot studies utilizing FOC for subsea and arctic conditions need to be developed and examined. Leak detection using new pipeline construction materials such as reinforced thermoplastics (RTP) also warrant further research due to a current lack of reliable technology for these materials.}

The time-of-flight (ToF) imager is one prominent representative in the family of smart imaging devices. It offers the capability of providing each pixel with range measuring functionality thus realizing millions of rangefinders in one tiny device. After the first proof of concept in the 1990s, a lot of technological advances steadily improved resolution, accuracy, power consumption, and size of ToF cameras. Today, the ToF-camera compactness is comparable to the size of standard mobile RGB cameras yielding to recent integration in mobile devices. Reason enough to treat this topic in a separate chapter of this book, giving insight into functional principle, system considerations, different ways to realize ToF pixels in CMOS, and finally an overview over the huge variety of applications possible with this young technology.}
