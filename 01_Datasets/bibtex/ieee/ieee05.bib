abstract={Future vehicles will be equipped with advanced communication capabilities and a multitude of sensing devices. Vehicle-to-vehicle and to Infrastructure (V2X) is one of these future technologies. V2X-technology-enabled vehicles are expected to become a great source of big data. This data, if gathered in the right time and processed in the right way, can enable an interesting number of existing and new applications. This can be a challenging task, taken into account the considerable size of the data that will be gathered. One of the challenges is to find a good balance between the number of data to filter out and the quality of the end data. This contribution tackles this specific challenge, by studying data storage cost reduction and evaluating its impact on the data quality. The proposed solution compares three approaches of treating the collected data at the road-side unit after taking out unnecessary information details. This solution has been tested and validated through simulations that show promising results.},

volume={},

pages={9-12},
abstract={In order to identify illegal websites efficiently, a recognition method based on feature similarity of multiple web page mixed elements is proposed. This method constructs the website feature vector based on the web page text content, access path, and website association platform attribute. The method calculates the similarity between the website to be judged and the historical website in the case base. Then, the average similarity of top k cases is selected as the basis for judging the possibility of illegal websites. The experiment shows that the judgment based on similarity can achieve better results in the context of fewer historical cases and better case data quality. Therefore, the method is suitable for scenes where it is difficult to obtain typical illegal website cases.},

The distribution of large data is characterized by "data island", "wide area dispersion", data dispersion, etc. Data types, data relationships and data quality are increasingly different, and contain a large number of unlabeled data, data sparse areas and domain knowledge. In order to solve the problem of multi-source heterogeneous data fusion, this paper innovatively introduces the Federal Learning algorithm, builds a Federal Learning Classifier, aggregates multiple fusion models of the same kind of data, and achieves the iterative optimization of data fusion without uploading data.

In order for the data to be an asset and not a liability, it is primordial to ensure that the data captured and maintained over time is accurate, traceable, reliable and current. However, very often, in order to complete a business function the data from one system may be exported to another system or to a third party tool, which also changes the data.

title={CounterMiner: Mining Big Performance Data from Hardware Counters},
year={2018},

pages={613-626},
abstract={Modern processors typically provide a small number of hardware performance counters to capture a large number of microarchitecture events. These counters can easily generate a huge amount (e.g., GB or TB per day) of data, which we call big performance data in cloud computing platforms with more than thousands of servers and millions of complex workloads running in a "24/7/365" manner. The big performance data provides a precious foundation for root cause analysis of performance bottlenecks, architecture and compiler optimization, and many more. However, it is challenging to extract value from the big performance data due to: 1) the many unperceivable errors (e.g., outliers and missing values); and 2) the difficulty of obtaining insights, e.g., relating events to performance. In this paper, we propose CounterMiner, a rigorous methodology that enables the measurement and understanding of big performance data by using data mining and machine learning techniques. It includes three novel components: 1) using data cleaning to improve data quality by replacing outliers and filling in missing values; 2) iteratively quantifying, ranking, and pruning events based on their importance with respect to performance; 3) quantifying interaction intensity between two events by residual variance. We use sixteen benchmarks (eight from CloudSuite and eight from the Spark version of HiBench) to evaluate CounterMiner. The experimental results show that CounterMiner reduces the average error from 28.3% to 7.7% when multiplexing 10 events on 4 hardware counters. We also conduct a real-world case study, showing that identifying important configuration parameters of Spark programs by event importance is much faster than directly ranking the importance of these parameters.},

pages={495-502},
abstract={In the era of big data, privacy becomes a challenging issue which already attracts a good number of research efforts. In the literature, most of existing privacy preserving algorithms focus on protecting users' privacy from being disclosed by making the set of designated semi-id features indiscriminate. However, how to automatically determine the appropriate semi-id features from high-dimensional correlated data is seldom studied. Therefore, in this paper we first theoretically study the problem and propose the IPFS algorithm to find all possible features forming the candidate semi-id feature set which can infer users' privacy. Then, the KIPFS algorithm is proposed to find the key features from the candidate semi-id feature set. By anonymizing the key feature set, called as key inferring privacy features (KIPFS), users' privacy is protected. To evaluate the effectiveness and the efficacy of the proposed approach, two state-of-the-art algorithms, i.e., K-anonymity and t-closeness, applied on the designated semi-id feature set are chose as the baseline algorithms and their revised versions are applied on the KIPFS for the performance comparison. The promising results showed that by anonymizing the identified KIPFS, both aforementioned algorithms can achieve better performance than the original ones in terms of efficiency and data quality.},

abstract={As the power system develops from informatization to intelligence. Research on data services based on the Internet of Things (IoT) focuses more on application functions, but the research on the data quality of the IoT itself is insufficient. Long-term continuous operation of the big data IoT system has the risk of performance degradation or even partial fault, which leads to a decrease in the availability of collected data for intelligent analysis. In this article, based on the power IoT message data, the characteristics are established through a variety of improved detection methods, and then the abnormal data type is obtained through Q learning and fusion of the random forest (RF) identification features. Finally, the topology of the specific power user IoT system is combined with kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) + improved RF algorithm getting the abnormal location of the IoT. The results show that the research method has a significantly higher positioning accuracy (from 61% to 97%) than the traditional RF method, and the combination method has more advantages in parameter adjustment and classification accuracy than directly using a multilayer perceptron (MLP).},

abstract={Power companies can use the power grid big data platform to cluster analysis of power metering data, which can improve the personalized service quality of power grid companies for different users and discover the power stealing behavior of users to protect the interests of power grid companies. However, in the cluster analysis of power measurement data, the privacy information of power users may also be disclosed. To defend the privacy information of power users, the article applies differential privacy technology to cluster analysis of power metering data to avoid power users’ privacy leakage. First, the article presents the attack model that exists in the cluster analysis of power metering data. Then, the article add Laplacian noise to the power metering data to defend against attacks in the cluster analysis of attackers. Next, to enhance the data availability of noise-added power measurement data in cluster analysis, the article limits noise distance based on the results of the cluster analysis. Experiments show that method proposed in article can guarantee the privacy information of power data during the cluster analysis of power metering data, and ensure the data quality of the power metering data after privacy protection.},

number={9},
pages={2965-2975},
abstract={Multi-modal neuroimages, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), can provide complementary structural and functional information of the brain, thus facilitating automated brain disease identification. Incomplete data problem is unavoidable in multi-modal neuroimage studies due to patient dropouts and/or poor data quality. Conventional methods usually discard data-missing subjects, thus significantly reducing the number of training samples. Even though several deep learning methods have been proposed, they usually rely on pre-defined regions-of-interest in neuroimages, requiring disease-specific expert knowledge. To this end, we propose a spatially-constrained Fisher representation framework for brain disease diagnosis with incomplete multi-modal neuroimages. We first impute missing PET images based on their corresponding MRI scans using a hybrid generative adversarial network. With the complete (after imputation) MRI and PET data, we then develop a spatially-constrained Fisher representation network to extract statistical descriptors of neuroimages for disease diagnosis, assuming that these descriptors follow a Gaussian mixture model with a strong spatial constraint (i.e., images from different subjects have similar anatomical structures). Experimental results on three databases suggest that our method can synthesize reasonable neuroimages and achieve promising results in brain disease identification, compared with several state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract={Along with the development of the sensor system and sensor network, the wide applications of sensor networks have arisen at the historic moment. In reality, all kinds of sensors monitor every aspect of our life, which provides various services and brings the challenge: how to effectively integrate those distributed sensor resources and then can be used to find more advanced information or implement the sharing of resources are the big problems to be solved. Based on the framework of Sensor Web Enablement(SWE) which was proposed by Open GIS Consortium (OGC)and combined with the function of web crawler, we study and find Sensor Observation Service (SOS) service which is the core components of the SWE then we design a system based on the web crawler technology and the Istituto Scienze della Terra Sensor Observation Service (Istsos) architecture. The design of sensor network technology integration architecture includes three parts. The layer of data access which is the lowest layer encapsulates the access to the database or other source of resources. The layer of business logic it provides the core operation of component which was named Request Operator, this layer is used for processing various requests from the lowest layer in order to return the classes of listening. The layer of web and the client is connected, which can provide some thin client of SOS. The published server includes the ability of new services creation, addition of new sensors and relative metadata, visualization, and manipulation of stored observations, registration of new measures and setting of system properties like observable properties and data quality codes. In order to get sensor data, web crawler technology is used in our research, which can make us get sensor data from the target website, and the standardized sensor data is gotten by filtering the original data and then the data is uploaded to the database of Istsos with the standardized format. At last, the implementation of SOS architecture has been configured. The test's results show that the integrated architecture of services can effectively obtain the required sensor data and display them graphically.},

volume={7},

pages={3535-3544},
abstract={Crowdsensing enables a wide range of data collection, where the data are usually tagged with private locations. Protecting users' location privacy has been a central issue. The study of various location perturbation techniques, e.g., k-anonymity, for location privacy has received widespread attention. Despite the huge promise and considerable attention, provable good algorithms considering the tradeoff between location privacy and location information quality from the optimization perspective in crowdsensing are lacking in the literature. In this article, we study two related optimization problems from two different perspectives. The first problem is to minimize the location quality degradation caused by the protection of users' location privacy. We present an efficient optimal algorithm OLoQ for this problem. The second problem is to maximize the number of protected users, subject to a location quality degradation constraint. To satisfy the different requirements of the platform, we consider two cases for this problem: 1) overlapping and 2) nonoverlapping perturbations. For the former case, we give an efficient optimal algorithm OPUMO. For the latter case, we first prove its NP-hardness. We then design a (1-E)-approximation algorithm NPUMN and a fast and effective heuristic algorithm HPUMN. Extensive simulations demonstrate that OLoQ, OPUMO, and HPUMN significantly outperform an existing algorithm.},

abstract={The veracity related with data quality such as incomplete, imprecise and inconsistent data creates a major challenge to data mining and data analysis. Rough set theory provides a special tool for handling the imprecise and incomplete data in information systems. However, the existing rough set based incomplete data analysis methods may not be able to handle large amount of data within the acceptable time. This paper focuses on speeding up the incomplete data analysis. The computation of the lower and upper approximations is a vital step for improving the performance of rough set based data analysis process. In this paper, the lower and upper approximations are characterized as matrix-represented approximations. The resulting approximations are exploited as inputs for data analysis method LERS (Learning from Examples based on Rough Set) used with LEM2 (Learning from Examples Module, Version2) rule induction algorithm. Then, this paper provides a set of experiments on missing datasets with different missing percent. The experimental results on incomplete or missing datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository show that the proposed system effectively reduces the computational time in comparison with the existing system.},

abstract={Planning of current and future mobile networks is becoming increasingly complex due to the heterogeneity of deployments, which feature not only macrocells, but also an underlying layer of small cells whose deployment is not fully under the control of the operator. In this paper, we focus on selecting the most appropriate Quality of Service (QoS) prediction techniques for assisting network operators in planning future dense deployments. We propose to use machine learning as a tool to extract the relevant information from the huge amount of data generated in current 4G and future 5G networks during normal operation, which is then used to appropriately plan networks. In particular, we focus on radio measurements to develop correlative statistical models with the purpose of improving QoS-based network planning. In this direction, we combine multiple learners by building ensemble methods and use them to do regression in a reduced space rather than in the original one. We then compare the QoS prediction accuracy of various approaches that take as input the 3GPP Minimization of Drive Tests (MDT) measurements collected throughout a heterogeneous network and analyse their trade-offs. We also explain how the collected data is processed and used to predict QoS expressed in terms of Physical Resource Block (PRB)/ Megabit (MB) transmitted. This metric was selected because of the interest it may have for operators in planning, since it relates lower layer resources with their impact in terms of QoS up in the protocol stack, hence closer to the end-user.},

abstract={Utility services are experiencing a common problem of power losses, which impose a significant impact on their annual budget. Practically, power losses consist of technical losses and non-technical losses. Technical losses are due to operations and aging of infrastructure, while nontechnical losses (NTL) are due to non-metered energy. The focus is on managing non-technical losses using an automation wireless method. The wireless ZigBee technique is proposed and further investigated for communication failure over long distances while solving the problem of stealing electricity. Advance-metering infrastructure (AMI) technique and smart meters are feasible for system integration; that is why they are chosen to be part of this study. The success of the study depends on quality data of the Utility, meaning the more accurate the data, the easier the analysis of outliers. The operation and planning of revenue protection contain a large amount of data that needs to be worked on, so data mining assists in that regard. Then the load profiling method assists in illustrating the variation in demand/electricalload over a specific time. This is a preliminary investigation using a wireless communication technique as a viable solution in curbing electricity theft. The uniqueness of the proposed ZigBee system is that it recognizes the everyday act of stealing electricity through tempering with the meter box and tapping of the supply.},

abstract={Cloud computing (CC) is a useful tool for executing complex applications. As a result of this, it has become so popular and used in diverse domains such as science, engineering, medicine. etc. CC structure is composed of a number of virtual machines(VMs) provisioned on demand and charged on a "Pay-as-you-go" basis, it is deployed in different form of access levels. Complex applications needed to be executed on clouds are represented as workflows. Workflow scheduling (WS) is one of the most important concepts in cloud computing. WS model contributes to minimizing cost, makespan and energy as well as maximize the quality of service(QoS) of applications in clouds. Despite the security constraints set by each provider, CC has become so critical due to the considerations of applications with sensitive intermediate data, this thereby requires a security level known as Secured workflow Scheduling(SWS). This security is on the level of executing workflows. It indicates that applications with sensitive interdependent data have to be protected during their execution across different cloud VMs. The addition of security in workflow execution generates time overhead, making it complex to meet up with the QoS required by the users. Some research works have proposed algorithms for providing the QoS requirements and security at the same time. In this work, we survey some existing works, by defining the factors needed in securing workflows during execution, clarifying the domains for security, sources of security threats and their solutions as well as cloud computing services that needs security and lastly classify the proposed algorithm depending cloud computing components.},

This paper presents a novel solution using Hadoop Mapreduce to analyze large datasets and extract useful insights from the dataset which helps doctors to effectively allocate resources. The successful healthcare delivery and planning strongly rely on data (e.g. sensed data, diagnosis, administration information); the higher quality of the data, the better will be the patient assistance. The applications are also particularly exposed to a contextual environment (i.e., patient's mobility, communication technologies, performance, information heterogeneity, etc.) that has an important impact on information management and application achievement. The main objective of our system is to predict the risk of diabetic patients for readmission in the next 30 days by measuring the probability using MapReduce.

abstract={Dirty data is ubiquitous in real-world, and data cleaning is a long-standing problem. The importance of data cleaning is growing in the era of big data. In this paper we propose a novel data repairing approach by leveraging statistical relational learning (SRL). We learn Bayesian networks of attributes from the dirty data, then transform the dependency relationships among attributes into first-order logic formulas. We calculate the weight of each formula based on the mutual information of the attributes involved in the formula and obtain Markov logic network (often abbreviated as MLN) by assigning weight to each first-order logic formula. Then we transform Markov logic networks into inference rules and conduct these inference rules on DeepDive. The inference results are utilized to repair dirty data at last. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach has higher accuracy in terms of different situations and is universal for different kinds of datasets.},

abstract={This paper describes simple and efficient machine learning (ML) methods for efficiently detecting multiple types of power system events captured by PMUs scarcely placed in a large power grid. It uses a single feature from each PMU based on a rectangle area enclosing the event in a given data window. This single feature is sufficient to enable commonly used ML models to detect different types of events quickly and accurately. The feature is used by five ML models on four different data-window sizes. The results indicated a tradeoff between the execution speed and detection accuracy in variety of data-window size choices. The proposed method is insensitive to most data quality issues typical for data from field PMUs, and thus it does not require major data cleansing efforts prior to feature extraction.},

abstract={With the explosive increase of data volume, the research of data quality and data usability draws extensive attention. In this work, we focus on one aspect of data usability -- incomplete data imputation, and present a novel missing value imputation method using stacked auto-encoder and incremental clustering (SAICI). Specifically, SAICI's functionality rests on four pillars: (i) a distinctive value assigned to impute missing values initially, (ii) the stacked auto-encoder(SAE) applied to locate principal features, (iii) a new incremental clustering utilized to partition incomplete data set, and (iv) the top nearest neighbors' weighted values designed to refill the missing values. Most importantly, stages (ii)~(iv) iterate until convergence condition is satisfied. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only imputes the missing data values effectively, but also has better time performance. Moreover, this work is suitable for distributed data processing framework, which can be applied to the imputation of incomplete big data.},

As smartphones become a widely used device, we propose a conceptual design of a multi-device ground weather observation network using smartphones and other sensors. In this paper, we first investigate the differences between smartphone-based sensors and other sensors to determine issues to address for big data on global weather information.

Therefore, filling missing data in datasets is importance since the most of real-time datasets have a huge number of missing values. This paper first gives a comprehensive overview of various imputation methods for filling missing data. Then proposes a technique based on a popular Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equation (MICE) to fill numeric data in PV dataset. Finally analyses the impact of this technique and compares the performance with other imputation algorithms. For practice, this study uses historical measurement PV generation from the North PV site of Taiwan, and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) data consists of solar irradiance, temperature, sea level pressure, humidity, rainfall, wind speed. The NWP dataset is provided by Taiwan Central Weather Bureau (CWB) which is called Deterministic Weather Research and Forecasting (WRFD). Experimental results showed that the proposed imputation algorithm can improve short-term PV generation forecasting accuracy based on RMSE.},

At first, with the analysis of the interaction experience between the crowd sensing platform and mobile user, a trust scheme is introduced to guarantee the quality of sensing data by considering the direct trust and indirect trust. Next, according to the transaction between crowd sensing platform and mobile user, an optimal contract based on incentive scheme is designed to stimulate mobile users to participate in crowd sensing network, where the contract item can not only maximize the platform utility, but also satisfy individual rationality and incentive compatibility. Finally, the numerical results show that the proposal outperforms the conventional schemes.},

year={2022},
volume={},

abstract={Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving distributed machine learning paradigm. To motivate data owners to contribute towards FL, research on FL incentive mechanisms is gaining great interest. Existing monetary incentive mechanisms generally share the same FL model with all participants regardless of their contributions. Such an assumption can be unfair towards participants who contributed more and promote undesirable free-riding, especially when the final model is of great utility value to participants. In this paper, we propose a Fairness-Aware Incentive Mechanism for federated learning (FedFAIM) to address such problem. It satisfies two types of fairness notion: 1) aggregation fairness, which determines aggregation results according to data quality; 2) reward fairness, which assigns each participant a unique model with performance reflecting his contribution. Aggregation fairness is achieved through efficient gradient aggregation which examines local gradient quality and aggregates them based on data quality. Reward fairness is achieved through an efficient Shapley value-based contribution assessment method and a novel reward allocation method based on reputation and distribution of local and global gradients. We further prove reward fairness is theoretically guaranteed. Extensive experiments show that FedFAIM provides stronger incentives than similar non-monetary FL incentive mechanisms while achieving a high level of fairness.},

We used data from asthma home-based telemonitoring for advanced prediction of asthma exacerbation. The goal of this project was to develop an algorithm that predicts asthma exacerbation one day in advance based on previous 7-day window. CART was used for predictive modeling.

abstract={For various entering and transmission issues raised by human or system, missing events often occur in event data, which record execution logs of business processes. Without recovering the missing events, applications such as provenance analysis or complex event processing built upon event data are not reliable. Following the minimum change discipline in improving data quality, it is also rational to find a recovery that minimally differs from the original data. Existing recovery approaches fall short of efficiency owing to enumerating and searching over all of the possible sequences of events. In this paper, we study the efficient techniques for recovering missing events. According to our theoretical results, the recovery problem appears to be NP-hard. Nevertheless, advanced indexing, pruning techniques are developed to further improve the recovery efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate that our minimum recovery approach achieves high accuracy, and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art technique for up to five orders of magnitudes improvement in time performance.},

abstract={A key challenge in scientific simulation is that the simulation outputs often require intensive I/O and storage space to store the results for effective post hoc analysis. This paper focuses on a quality-aware adaptive temporal data selection and reconstruction problem where the goal is to adaptively select simulation data samples at certain key timesteps in situ and reconstruct the discarded samples with quality assurance during post hoc analysis. This problem is motivated by the limitation of current solutions that a significant amount of simulation data samples are either discarded or aggregated during the sampling process, leading to inaccuratemodeling of the simulated phenomena. Two unique challenges exist: 1) the sampling decisions have to be made in situ and adapted tothe dynamics of the complex scientific simulation data; 2) the reconstruction error must be strictly bounded to meet the application requirement. To address the above challenges, we developDeepSample, an error-controlled convolutional neural network framework, that jointly integrates a set of coherent multi-branch deep decoders to effectively reconstruct the simulation data with rigorous quality assurance. The results on two real-world scientific simulation applications show that DeepSample significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on both sampling efficiency and reconstructed simulation data quality.},

abstract={With the popularity of smart devices and the widespread use of the Wi-Fi-based indoor localization, edge computing is becoming the mainstream paradigm of processing massive sensing data to acquire indoor localization service. However, these data which were conveyed to train the localization model unintentionally contain some sensitive information of users/devices, and were released without any protection may cause serious privacy leakage. To solve this issue, we propose a lightweight differential privacy-preserving mechanism for the edge computing environment. We extend ε-differential privacy theory to a mature machine learning localization technology to achieve privacy protection while training the localization model. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets show that, compared with the original localization technology without privacy-preserving, our proposed scheme can achieve high accuracy of indoor localization while providing differential privacy guarantee. Through regulating the value of ε, the data quality loss of our method can be controlled up to 8.9% and the time consumption can be almost negligible. Therefore, our scheme can be efficiently applied in the edge networks and provides some guidance on indoor localization privacy protection in the edge computing.},

As an important part of the railway line, the existing railway bridge bears great live load, excessive concentrated force, obvious dynamic effect and high requirements for foundation stability. However, because the underwater structure of Railway Pier is constantly affected by many factors such as water scouring and ship collision during its service, it leads to a variety of diseases such as concrete peeling and exposed reinforcement. These diseases are often hidden in the water, which poses a serious threat to the structural safety of the bridge and the safety of people's lives and property. However, the traditional detection method of underwater structure of Railway Pier is affected by water flow, water quality, water depth and other environment, which has the pain points of high detection risk, low efficiency, poor detection data quality and missing disease location, so it is difficult to effectively detect underwater structure diseases; In this context, a multi-dimensional disease detection device is designed and developed for Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge (both highway and railway). The device includes a fixed module on water and an underwater detection module, which can realize safe and efficient detection under the condition of rapids and deep water, solve the problems that it is difficult for personnel and existing equipment to reach the structure to be tested, and the detection effect obtained by existing detection means is not ideal The detection information is not comprehensive, which is difficult to be used for key problems such as follow-up structural technical state evaluation.},

abstract={With the development of motor vehicles, the circulation demand of motor vehicles in the form of "second-hand cars" in circulation links is increasing. As a special "e-commerce commodity", second-hand cars are more complicated than ordinary e-commerce commodities. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the price of second-hand cars, which is not only influenced by the basic configuration of the car, but also by the car conditions. At present, the state has not issued a standard to judge the value of second-hand car. To solve this problem, in this paper, first making feature engineering, which includes data preprocessing and feature screening. Data preprocessing includes data cleaning and data transformation, data cleaning includes removing outliers and filling missing values, and data transformation is used to unify data format to improve data quality. The feature screening includes correlation analysis and feature extraction based on LightMBG, and the screened features provide the basis for model building, training and prediction. Then, five regression models are constructed by using the feature attributes obtained by the feature engineering for training, and evaluated. Then, Random Forest and XGBoost are weighted and mixed to got a novel regression model, and the effect of the model is better than that of the five regression models. Finally, the novel regression model is used to predict the price of second-hand cars.},

abstract={The deployment of future intelligent transportation systems is contingent upon seamless and reliable operation of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). One key challenge in developing CAVs is the design of an autonomous controller that can accurately execute near real-time control decisions, such as a quick acceleration when merging to a highway and frequent speed changes in a stop-and-go traffic. However, the use of conventional feedback controllers or traditional learning-based controllers, solely trained by each CAV’s local data, cannot guarantee a robust controller performance over a wide range of road conditions and traffic dynamics. In this paper, a new federated learning (FL) framework enabled by large-scale wireless connectivity is proposed for designing the autonomous controller of CAVs. In this framework, the learning models used by the controllers are collaboratively trained among a group of CAVs. To capture the varying CAV participation in the FL training process and the diverse local data quality among CAVs, a novel dynamic federated proximal (DFP) algorithm is proposed that accounts for the mobility of CAVs, the wireless fading channels, as well as the unbalanced and non-independent and identically distributed data across CAVs. A rigorous convergence analysis is performed for the proposed algorithm to identify how fast the CAVs converge to using the optimal autonomous controller. In particular, the impacts of varying CAV participation in the FL process and diverse CAV data quality on the convergence of the proposed DFP algorithm are explicitly analyzed. Leveraging this analysis, an incentive mechanism based on contract theory is designed to improve the FL convergence speed. Simulation results using real vehicular data traces show that the proposed DFP-based controller can accurately track the target CAV speed over time and under different traffic scenarios. Moreover, the results show that the proposed DFP algorithm has a much faster convergence compared to popular FL algorithms such as federated averaging (FedAvg) and federated proximal (FedProx). The results also validate the feasibility of the contract-theoretic incentive mechanism and show that the proposed mechanism can improve the convergence speed of the DFP algorithm by 40% compared to the baselines.},

abstract={Ensuring data quality is central to the digital transformation in industry. Business processes such as predictive maintenance or condition monitoring can be implemented or improved based on the available data. In order to guarantee high data quality, a single data validation system are usually used to validate the production data for further use. However, using a single system allows an attacker only to perform one successful attack to corrupt the whole system. We present a new approach in which a data validation system using multiple different validators minimizes the probability of success for the attacker. The validators are arranged in clusters based on their properties. For a validation process, a challenge is given that specifies which validators should perform the current validation. Validation results from other validators are dropped. This ensures that even for more than half of the validators being corrupted anomalies can be detected during the validation process.},

abstract={Data are critical in this age of big data and machine learning. Due to their inherent complexity, health-related data are unique in that the datasets are usually acquired for specific purposes and with special designs. As more and more healthcare datasets become available, of which many are public, choosing a quality dataset that is suitable for specific research inquiries is becoming a challenging question for health informatics researchers, especially the learners of this field. On the other hand, from the data provider's perspective, it is important to identify features of datasets that make some datasets more valuable than others so as to improve the design and acquisition of future datasets. To address these questions, we need to develop formal mechanisms to measure the goodness of datasets according to certain criteria. In this study, we propose one way of measuring the value of healthcare datasets that is based on how often the datasets are used and reported by researchers, which we call the Publication-based Popularity Index (PPI). In this article, we describe the design of the PPI and discuss its properties. We demonstrate the utility of the PPI by ranking 14 representative healthcare datasets. We believe that the PPI can enable an overall ranking of all healthcare datasets and thus provide an important dimension to sort search results for dataset integration systems as well as a starting point for identifying and examining the design of the most valuable healthcare datasets so that features of these datasets can inform future designs.},

We consider that these issues can be dealt with in the context of Ontology Based Data Access (OBDA). OBDA is a new data management paradigm that exploits the semantic knowledge represented in ontologies when querying data stored in a database.

abstract={The electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, as one of the most important vital signs, can provide indications of many heart-related diseases. Nonetheless, in the case of telehealth context, the automated analysis and accurate detection of ECG signals remain unsolved issues, because the poor data quality collected by the wearable devices and unprofessional users further increases the complexity of hand-crafted feature extraction, ultimately affecting the efficiency of feature extraction and the detection accuracy. To address this issue and improve the detection accuracy, in this paper we present a novel detection scheme with the raw ECG signal in wearable telehealth system. Our system benefits from the concept of big data, sensing and pervasive computing and the emerging deep learning technology. In particular, a Deep Heartbeat Classification (DHC) scheme is proposed to analyze the ECG signal for arrhythmia detection. Distinct from existing solutions, the detection model in DHC can be trained directly on the raw ECG signal without hand-crafted feature extraction. A cloud-based prototypical system is also designed and implemented with the functions of data acquisition, wireless transmission, back-end data management, and ECG detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our prototypical system is feasible and effective in real-world practice, and extensive experimentation based on the MIT-BIH database demonstrates that the proposed DHC scheme outperforms baseline schemes.},

year={2015},
volume={},

pages={1737-1742},
abstract={In recent power grid systems, data-driven approach has been taken to grid condition evaluation and classification after successful adoption of big data techniques in internet applications. However, the raw training data from single monitoring system, e.g. dissolved gas analysis (DGA), are rarely sufficient for training in the form of valid instances and the data quality can rarely meet the requirement of precise data analytics since raw data set usually contains samples with noisy data. This paper proposes a machine learning scheme (PCA_IR) to improve the accuracy of fault diagnose, which combines dimension-increment procedure based on association analysis, dimension-reduction procedure based on principal component analysis and back propagation neural network (BPNN). First, the dimension of training data is increased by adding selected data which originates from different source such as production management system (PMS) to the original data obtained by DGA. The added data would also inevitably result in more noise. Thus, we then take advantage of the PCA method to reduce the noise in the training data as well as retaining significant information for classification. Finally, the new training data yielded after PCA procedure is inputted into BPNN for classification. We test the PCA_IR scheme on fault diagnosis of power transformers in power grid system. The experimental results show that the classifiers based on our scheme achieve higher accuracy than traditional ones. Therefore, the scheme PCA_IR would be successfully deployed for fault diagnosis in power grid system.},

year={2022},
volume={60},

pages={1-13},
abstract={Recorded seismograms are usually distorted by statics owing to complex geological conditions, such as lateral variations in sediment thickness or complex topographies. These distorted and discontinuous signals usually exist in either arrival times or amplitudes of waves, and they are most likely to be smeared as velocity perturbations along their associated raypaths. Therefore, statics may blur images of the target bodies or, even worse, introduce unexpected and false anomalies into subsurface structures. To partly resolve this problem, we develop a weighted statics correction method to estimate unwanted temporal shifts of traces using the closure-phase technique, which is utilized in astronomical imaging. In the proposed method, the source and receiver statics are regarded as independent quantities contributing to the waveform shifts based on their acquisition geometries. Numerical tests on both the synthetic and field cases show noticeable, although gradual, improvements in data quality compared to the conventional plus–minus (PM) method. In general, this method provides a straightforward strategy to reedit the travel times in seismic profiles without inverting for a near-surface velocity model. Moreover, it can be extended to any interferometrical methods in seismic data processing that satisfies the closure-phase conditions.},

abstract={Developing Question Answering systems (QA) is one of the main goals in Artificial Intelligence. With the advent of Deep Learning (DL) techniques, QA systems have witnessed significant advances. Although DL performs very well on QA, it requires a considerable amount of annotated data for training. Many annotated datasets have been built for the QA task; most of them are exclusively in English. In order to address the need for a high-quality QA dataset in the Persian language, we present PersianQuAD, the native QA dataset for the Persian language. We create PersianQuAD in four steps: 1) Wikipedia article selection, 2) question-answer collection, 3) three-candidates test set preparation, and 4) Data Quality Monitoring. PersianQuAD consists of approximately 20,000 questions and answers made by native annotators on a set of Persian Wikipedia articles. The answer to each question is a segment of the corresponding article text. To better understand PersianQuAD and ensure its representativeness, we analyze PersianQuAD and show it contains questions of varying types and difficulties. We also present three versions of a deep learning-based QA system trained with PersianQuAD. Our best system achieves an F1 score of 82.97% which is comparable to that of QA systems on English SQuAD, made by the Stanford University. This shows that PersianQuAD performs well for training deep-learning-based QA systems. Human performance on PersianQuAD is significantly better (96.49%), demonstrating that PersianQuAD is challenging enough and there is still plenty of room for future improvement. PersianQuAD and all QA models implemented in this paper are freely available.},

abstract={Data quality is one of the most important problems in data management, since dirty data often leads to inaccurate data analytics results and wrong business decisions. According to a report by InsightSquared in 2012, poor data across businesses and the government cost the United States economy 3.1 trillion dollars a year. To detect data errors, data quality rules or integrity constraints (ICs) have been proposed as a declarative way to describe legal or correct data instances. Any subset of data that does not conform to the defined rules is considered erroneous, which is also referred to as a violation. Various kinds of data repairing techniques with different objectives have been introduced where algorithms are used to detect subsets of the data that violate the declared integrity constraints, and even to suggest updates to the database such that the new database instance conforms with these constraints. While some of these algorithms aim to minimally change the database, others involve human experts or knowledge bases to verify the repairs suggested by the automatic repeating algorithms. Trends in Cleaning Relational Data: Consistency and Deduplication discusses the main facets and directions in designing error detection and repairing techniques. It proposes a taxonomy of current anomaly detection techniques, including error types, the automation of the detection process, and error propagation. It also sets out a taxonomy of current data repairing techniques, including the repair target, the automation of the repair process, and the update model. It concludes by highlighting current trends in "big data" cleaning.},

The electrical industry can benefit from these new platforms to automate existing processes and provide engineers and field crew with access to large amounts of complex data in real-time, anywhere in the world. The development of a standards-based application decouples the mobile client application from a single vendor or existing enterprise system, but requires a complex data integration architecture to support the use and exploitation of large amounts of data spread across multiple existing systems. The integration with a mobile application introduces new challenges when dealing with remote devices where data network communications cannot be relied on, especially under storm conditions, and the devices themselves are at risk of being lost or stolen. Addressing these challenges offers the potential to improve data quality, enable access to accurate, up-to-date information in the field and ultimately save a utility time and money.},

abstract={The use of time series prediction results in benefits for an organization. Forecasting efficiency relies on applied prediction formula and quality of data received from technical devices and manually inputted. They are often of low quality, with inconsistencies. However, high data quality is crucial for efficient forecasting/prediction purposes (also event detection from time series and pattern recognition), in particular during large data sets processing (often heterogeneous, including data obtained from IoT devices). Such processing should cover inconsistency analysis, interpolation of missing/lacking data, as well as the use of data pre-transformations. The paper presents problems of inconsistent, nonstationary data prediction on the example of stock level daily forecasting. Selected methods of time series interpolation are outlined. Results of implementation of algorithms for short-term time series prediction are illustrated and discussed. Prediction quality measured based on errors values calculated both in total and in a moving window is discussed. A concept of an adaptive algorithm based on a change in the prognostic formula depending on short-term characteristics of time series is outlined.},

pages={61145-61169},
abstract={Context: Mobile application developers are getting more concerned due to the importance of quality requirements or non-functional requirements (NFR) in software quality. Developers around the globe are actively asking a question(s) and sharing solutions to the problems related to software development on Stack Overflow (SO). The knowledge shared by developers on SO contains useful information related to software development such as feature requests (functional/non-functional), code snippets, reporting bugs or sentiments. Extracting the NFRs shared by iOS developers on programming Q&A website SO has become a challenge and a less researched area. Objective: To identify and understand the real problems, needs, trends, and the critical NFRs or quality requirements discussed on Stack Overflow related to iOS mobile application development. Method: We extracted and used only the iOS posts data of SO. We applied the well-known statistical topical model Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify the main topics in iOS posts on SO. Then, we labeled the extracted topics with quality requirements or NFRs by using the wordlists to assess the trend, evolution, hot and unresolved NFRs in all iOS discussions. Results: Our findings revealed that the highly frequent topics the iOS developers discussed are related to usability, reliability, and functionality followed by efficiency. Interestingly, the most problematic areas unresolved are also usability, reliability, and functionality though followed by portability. Besides, the evolution trend of each of the six different quality requirements or NFRs over time is depicted through comprehensive visualization. Conclusion: Our first empirical investigation on approximately 1.5 million iOS posts and comments of SO gives insight on comprehending the NFRs in iOS application development through the lens of real-world practitioners.},

year={2019},
volume={221},
number={1},
pages={1145-1164},
abstract={Seismic tomography has arrived at the threshold of the era of big data. However, how to extract information optimally from every available time-series remains a challenge; one that is directly related to the objective function chosen as a distance metric between observed and synthetic data. Time-domain cross-correlation and frequency-dependent multitaper traveltime measurements are generally tied to window selection algorithms in order to balance the amplitude differences between seismic phases. Even then, such measurements naturally favour the dominant signals within the chosen windows. Hence, it is difficult to select all usable portions of seismograms with any sort of optimality. As a consequence, information ends up being lost, in particular from scattered waves. In contrast, measurements based on instantaneous phase allow extracting information uniformly over the seismic records without requiring their segmentation. And yet, measuring instantaneous phase, like any other phase measurement, is impeded by phase wrapping. In this paper, we address this limitation by using a complex-valued phase representation that we call ‘exponentiated phase’. We demonstrate that the exponentiated phase is a good substitute for instantaneous-phase measurements. To assimilate as much information as possible from every seismogram while tackling the non-linearity of inversion problems, we discuss a flexible hybrid approach to combine various objective functions in adjoint seismic tomography. We focus on those based on the exponentiated phase, to take into account relatively small-magnitude scattered waves; on multitaper measurements of selected surface waves; and on cross-correlation measurements on specific windows to select distinct body-wave arrivals. Guided by synthetic experiments, we discuss how exponentiated-phase, multitaper and cross-correlation measurements, and their hybridization, affect tomographic results. Despite their use of multiple measurements, the computational cost to evaluate gradient kernels for the objective functions is scarcely affected, allowing for issues with data quality and measurement challenges to be simultaneously addressed efficiently.},

abstract={With the increasing share of renewable generation in low voltage distribution, the edge of the power grid is slowly replacing classical, large-scale power stations, taking up roles and responsibilities that were unimaginable only a few years ago. However, while feed-in on the 400V level is now commonplace, grid state and power quality monitoring still lag far behind because of obvious cost and complexity reasons. In fact, only very few parts of Germanys approx. 1,1 million km long 400V distribution grid are actively monitored today and even basic grid quality parameters such as the voltage level at the end of the line are typically unknown. Reducing the cost per measurement point and the complexity of data analysis is thus of paramount importance for enabling wide-area monitoring of the LV power grid. The authors explore the feasibility of this goal by examining the performance of a nonconventional measurement system. It consists of a network of Internet-of-Things (IOT)-based power quality sensors, connected to a cloud-based big data analysis platform. Specifically, measurement nodes comprise of voltage sensors attached to consumer-grade smartphones and WIFI access points. Sensor data is automatically uploaded to the cloud system with the MQTT protocol. First results from a field trial in a rural area in Germany indicate good data quality and show excellent promise for detailed assessments of the edge of the power grid.},

abstract={The scale operation in various forms of rural land circulation in China is the way for the development of modern agriculture, and is also the basic direction of agricultural reform. The right to rural land contractual management registration makes the position of cadastral land and its interrelated information, as contractor and area, clear by Geographic Information Systems (GIS). That supplied a data base for land circulation spatial management. In this paper, we discussed the correlation between the management and the spatial position of transferred rural land, in order to support the policy and decision for agriculture. Taking Zhengjia Town as an example, which located in the west of Dongchangfu District, Liaocheng, Shandong, we made a survey and got the information about the land circulation, the operators who engaged in the transferred land, and the farmers who had transferred their farmlands from 2011 to 2015. Based on the outcome data of right to rural land contractual management registration, the circulation parcels and the cadastral parcels were linked by their only parcel code, and then formed the land circulation spatial information. Using ArcGIS 10.1 for spatial analysis and correlation analysis, we analyzed the correlation between the management and the spatial evolution of the transferred land on some indicators including acquirement intention, operation style, land use, circulation variability, distribution of circulation management right, and compared the income of the operators and the farmers. According to the survey, the scope of the transferred land was gradually increased. The area was 16.09ha in 2011 and 147.27ha in 2015, 19.22% of the contracted land. The results show that the main form of land circulation was to rent, and scale operation in northern and fragmented operation in southern. The transferred lands which were acquired by family contract have the largest area. However, in the south, the farmers seemed like to transfer their lands which were acquired by bidding. The operators aged in 40-49 managed the most transferred land, accounting for 77.00% of the total circulation area. Followed by 39 years old under, and the over 50 years old was the least. Before transferred, all farmland was used to grow grain. But 93% farmlands were changed the crops after land circulation. As the investment of time, capital, farmland and implied labor increased, there was a certain increase in income of the operators and the farmers, however, and a few operators had no profit because of the business model. There was no spatial correlation between the farmlands position and the farmers' income at the fragmented operation region. The results can provide an idea for spatial information management of land circulation based on GIS, and defend the farmers' contractual rights when the boundaries are destroyed. With the spatial informatization of farmland and the improvement of data quality and quantity, big data will further predict land circulation spatial arrangement and business model.},

abstract={In pervasive computing research and literature, context has mostly been seen as an information source for applications that adapt their behavior according to the current situation of their user or their (often physical) environment. This adaptation could be the change of the user interface, the performance of actions (like sending messages or triggering actuators), or the change of used resources (like network bandwidth or processing power). To determine relevant situations, many heterogeneous data sources could be used, ranging from sensor data over mined patterns in files to explicit user input. Since most sensors are not perfect, context quality has to be considered. And since many context-aware applications are mobile, the set of data sources may change during runtime. According to the widely used definition by Anind Dey, context can be “any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity”. In the past years, we have seen a significant increase in the so-called “big data” domain, in research, technology, and industrial usage. The desire to analyze, gain knowledge and use more and more data it in new ways is rising in a way that resemble a gold rush. Data is the new oil. Beside applications like predictive maintenance of machines or optimization of industrial processes, a main target for big data analyses are humans - in their roles as travelers, current or potential clients, or application users. We could say that big data is “any information that can be used to characterize the situation of a user”, and relate these approaches to what have been done in context modelling and reasoning. This gets even clearer when these analyses leave the virtual world (e.g., client behavior in web shops) and enter the real world (e.g., client behavior in retail). In addition to the ambiguities of the analysis itself that only leads to predictions with a limited probability, sensor data quality becomes an issue: the sensor data might be inaccurate, outdated or conflicting with other observations or physical laws; in addition, sensor data processing algorithms like object classification or tracking might lead to ambiguous results. In this talk, we will shortly review these two domains and derive what could be learned for context-aware applications. A special focus will be given on quality of context on all semantic levels, and how the improper consideration of quality issues can lead to dangerous digital prejudices.},

abstract={Spatial trajectory data is widely available today. Over a sustained period of time, trajectory data has been collected from numerous GPS devices, smartphones, sensors and social media applications. How do we manage them? What values can a business derive from them, and how? Due to their very large volumes, the nature of streaming itself, highly variable levels of data quality, as well as many possible links with other types of data, making sense of spatial trajectory data is one of the crucial areas for big data analytics. In this talk, we will introduce this increasingly important research area in the context of new applications, new problems and new opportunities. We will discuss recent advances in trajectory data management and trajectory mining, from their foundations to high performance processing with modern computing infrastructures.},
