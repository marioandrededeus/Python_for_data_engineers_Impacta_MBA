        "abstract":"Big data are large volumes of digital data that can be collected from disparate sources and are challenging to analyze. These data are often described with the five \u201cVs\u201d: volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and value. Perioperative nurses contribute to big data through documentation in the electronic health record during routine surgical care, and these data have implications for clinical decision making, administrative decisions, quality improvement, and big data science. This article explores methods to improve the quality of perioperative nursing data and provides examples of how these data can be combined with broader nursing data for quality improvement. We also discuss a national action plan for nursing knowledge and big data science and how perioperative nurses can engage in collaborative actions to transform health care. Standardized perioperative nursing data has the potential to affect care far beyond the original patient.",

        "abstract":"In the face of green energy initiatives and progressively increasing shares of more energy-efficient buildings, there is a pressing need to transform district heating towards low-temperature district heating. The substantially lowered supply temperature of low-temperature district heating broadens the opportunities and challenges to integrate distributed renewable energy, which requires enhancement on intelligent heating load prediction. Meanwhile, to fulfill the temperature requirements for domestic hot water and space heating, separate energy conversion units on user-side, such as building-sized boosting heat pumps shall be implemented to upgrade the temperature level of the low-temperature district heating network. This study conducted hybrid heating load prediction methods with long-term and short-term prediction, and the main work consisted of four steps: (1) acquisition and processing of district heating data of 20 district heating supplied nursing homes in the Nordic climate (2016\u20132019); (2) long-term district heating load prediction through linear regression, energy signature curve in hourly resolution, providing an overall view and boundary conditions for the unit sizing; (3) short-term district heating load prediction through two Artificial Neural Network models, f72 and g120, with different prediction input parameters; (4) evaluation of the predicted load profiles based on the measured data. Although the three prediction models met the quality criteria, it was found that including the historical hourly heating loads as the input to the forecasting model enhanced the prediction quality, especially for the peak load and low-mild heating season. Furthermore, a possible application of the heating load profiles was proposed by integrating two building-sized heat pumps in low-temperature district heating, which may be a promising heat supply method in low-temperature district heating.",

        "abstract":"A gap in informatics expertise amongst nursing students, practising staff and faculty has been noted globally, which reduces the potential for nurses to utilise technology to enhance patient care. National nursing education strategies and recommendations from professional associations have identified digital health as an area that needs investment. This case study describes how health informatics is being integrated into a Bachelor of Nursing programme in the United Kingdom. An international collaboration with a US-UK Fulbright Specialist Scholar enabled individual learning units corresponding to key health informatics competencies to be designed and incorporated into a pedagogic framework grounded in the spiral learning approach. This approach is proposed as one way to integrate informatics into nursing education, so students can become competent clinicians that are able to deliver technology enabled care in the health service.",
