abstract: The rigor and reproducibility of science methods depends heavily on the
  appropriate use of statistical methods to answer research questions and make meaningful
  and accurate inferences based on data. The increasing analytic complexity and valuation
  of novel statistical and methodological approaches to data place greater emphasis
  on statistical review. We will outline the controversies within statistical sciences
  that threaten rigor and reproducibility of research published in the behavioral
  sciences and discuss ongoing approaches to generate reliable and valid inferences
  from data. We outline nine major areas to consider for generally evaluating the
  rigor and reproducibility of published articles and apply this framework to the
  116 Behaviour Research and Therapy (BRAT) articles published in 2018. The results
  of our analysis highlight a pattern of missing rigor and reproducibility elements,
  especially pre-registration of study hypotheses, links to statistical code/output,
  and explicit archiving or sharing data used in analyses. We recommend reviewers
  consider these elements in their peer review and that journals consider publishing
  results of these rigor and reproducibility ratings with manuscripts to incentivize
  authors to publish these elements with their manuscript.

abstract: 'Complete blood count (CBC) analysis is one of the most commonly ordered
  laboratory tests and is a critical first step in patients'' clinical evaluation.
  However, CBC analyzers are limited in their ability to positively identify several
  types of white blood cells (WBC), and cells with substantial clinical significance,
  such as immature granulocytes or blasts, are merely marked as flags. Also, CBC analyzers
  fall short of recognizing informative red blood cell (RBC) morphology, such as schistocytes,
  and often provide inaccurate platelets count. Flags and clinically non-sufficient
  CBC-derived data reflex to generation of blood smear (BS), and BS review comprises
  a substantial portion of the workload in routine hematology laboratories. For accurate
  identification and classification of WBC, BS analysis (BSA) requires detailed observation
  of cells with high-magnification objective (60-100X), which provides a relatively
  narrow Field of View (FOV). This physical limitation restricts current BSA to either
  low resolution/wide FOV or to high resolution/narrow FOV data generation (Fig. 1A).
  Hence, key issues of BSA such as the effects of the smearing process on the distribution
  of blood components, the effects of cells distribution on their morphology and further
  classification, as well as many other attributes, are addressed only qualitatively
  or empirically, leaving the real topology of the BS obscure. The computational imaging
  microscopy system presented herein uses a low resolution and wide FOV objective,
  and records a plurality of images under different illumination conditions, of the
  same sample area (Fig. 1B). An algorithm reconstructs a high resolution and aberration
  free image of whole specimens, as can be observed in the attached link (https://tinyurl.com/Scopio-Labs-X100-ASH-2020).
  High resolution images are critical not only for manual BSA, but also for artificial
  intelligence (AI)-derived BSA, since data quality is of prime importance for deep-learning
  processes, and to a large extent determine their outcome. Thus, the combination
  of high resolution/wide FOV turns each BS into a big data analytic field, rendering
  the measurement of yet undetermined cell characteristics. In order to elucidate
  the basic topology, 60 normal BS (28 females, 32 males) were subjected to analysis
  utilizing this novel computational imaging microscopy. For convenience of analysis
  and comparison with current BSA methodology, BS were segmented into strips according
  to RBC density (Fig. 1C, D). The average length of smear from females (F) was higher
  by nearly 28% compared with smear from males (M), and the presence of acute inflammation
  (A) resulted in a significant 33% increase in overall smear length compared to normal
  (N) average (Fig. 1E). As expected, RBC density formed a linear gradient (Fig. 1C)
  along the axis of sample smearing, however, RBC morphology was affected by location
  within the BS. For example, strips 4-5 contained RBC with the appearance of spherocytes
  (Fig. 1F; arrows), while in strips with increased RBC density, cells aggregated
  resembling rouleaux formation (Fig. 1F; arrowheads). Platelets distribution was
  non-linear, with only a few of them reaching the feathered edge of the smear (Fig.
  1G). Since the variance of both RBC/FOV and platelets/FOV concentrations drops starting
  with strip 4, BS-derived platelets number estimates should not be performed in strips
  1-3. On average, a normal BS contains 890+399 WBC in the scanned area (strips 1-8).
  Similar to RBC, the location of individual WBC throughout the BS may affect their
  morphology, and hence their classification. WBC in the feathered edge (strips 1-3)
  are generally more stretched, and often squeezed between RBC, rendering their classification
  by AI-based tools challenging (Fig. 1H). In strips 4-7, WBC morphology is optimal
  for a classification task, enabling favorable outcomes for either manual or AI cell
  analysis (Fig. 1H). These data indicate that BSA can be taken to a sensitivity level
  of at least 10-3 of WBC analysis, provided that a large portion of the BS is scanned.
  Our system provides a novel combination of computational imaging microscopy and
  AI-based classification tools to unravel the complex topology of blood smears, and
  upgrade the data obtained in BSA. This approach enables the establishment of quantitative
  rules to scientifically direct the objective analysis of cellular blood components
  both manually, and by AI-tools. Figure

abstract: Celiac disease (CD) has been on the rise in the world and a large part of
  it remains undiagnosed. Novel methods are required to address the gaps in prompt
  detection and management. Artificial intelligence (AI) has seen an exponential surge
  in the last decade worldwide. With the advent of big data and powerful computational
  ability, we now have self-driving cars and smart devices in our daily lives. Huge
  databases in the form of electronic medical records and images have rendered healthcare
  a lucrative sector where AI can prove revolutionary. It is being used extensively
  to overcome the barriers in clinical workflows. From the perspective of a disease,
  it can be deployed in multiple steps i.e. screening tools, diagnosis, developing
  novel therapeutic agents, proposing management plans, and defining prognostic indicators,
  etc. We review the areas where it may augment physicians in the delivery of better
  healthcare by summarizing current literature on the use of AI in healthcare using
  CD as a model. We further outline major barriers to its large-scale implementations
  and prospects from the healthcare point of view.

abstract: Coseismic slip distributions of repeated earthquakes are important data
  used to forecast magnitude and recurrence characteristics of future earthquakes.
  Many studies infer coseismic slip of past individual paleoearthquakes from frequency
  histograms of geomorphic offsets. Such histograms, often expressed as a COPD (cumulative
  offset probability distribution), commonly show multiple peaks with similar displacements,
  which are interpreted to be incremental slip associated with successive paleoearthquakes.
  However, assumptions in linking COPD peaks to individual earthquakes have not been
  fully explored. Here, we combine statistical modeling with global historical coseismic
  surface rupture data to evaluate the conditions required for the approach. The results
  show that only coseismic slip with low variability allow more than one event identification;
  for example, even low CoVs (coefficient of offset variation) of 0.25 and 0.35 permit
  identification of only 2 to 3 events. In contrast, the mean CoV value for all historical
  ruptures is 0.58 to 0.66. Furthermore, interpreting the first COPD peak as a single-event
  slip distribution could result in artificially low variation and flatter distribution
  of offset than observed in historical earthquakes. This study cautions that robust
  COPD interpretation on large strike-slip faults requires low offset variability,
  a sufficient number of offset measurements, and additional constraints like historical
  coseismic slip data or paleoseismic event sequence data.

abstract: Studies have indicated that detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) prior
  to treatment is a negative prognostic marker in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
  ctDNA is currently identified by detection of tumor mutations. Commercial next-generation
  sequencing (NGS) assays for mutation analysis of ctDNA for routine practice usually
  include small gene panels and are not suitable for general mutation analysis. In
  this study, we investigated whether mutation analysis of cfDNA could be performed
  using a commercially available comprehensive NGS gene panel and bioinformatics workflow.
  Tumor DNA, plasma DNA and peripheral blood leukocyte DNA from 30 NSCLC patients
  were sequenced. In two patients (7%), tumor mutations in cfDNA were immediately
  called by the bioinformatic workflow. In 13 patients (43%), tumor mutations were
  not called, but were present in ctDNA and were identified based on the known tumor
  mutation profile. In the remaining 15 patients (50%), no concordant mutations were
  detected. In conclusion, we were able to identify tumor mutations in ctDNA from
  57% of NSCLC patients using a comprehensive gene panel. We demonstrated that sequencing
  paired tumor DNA was helpful to interpret data and confirm ctDNA, and thus increased
  the ratio of patients with detectable ctDNA. This approach might be feasible for
  mutation analysis of ctDNA in routine diagnostic practice, especially in case of
  suboptimal plasma quality and quantity.

abstract: The pedotransfer function is a mathematical model used to convert direct
  soil measurements into known and unknown soil properties. It provides information
  for modelling and simulation in soil research, hydrology, environmental science
  and climate change impacts, including investigating the carbon cycle and the exchange
  of carbon between soils and the atmosphere to support carbon farming. In particular,
  the pedotransfer function can provide input parameters for landscape design, soil
  quality assessment and economic optimisation. The objective of the study was to
  investigate the feasibility of using a generalised pedotransfer function derived
  with a machine learning method to predict soil electrical conductivity (EC) and
  soil organic carbon content (OC) for different regional locations in the state of
  Victoria, Australia. This strategy supports a unified approach to the interpolation
  and population of a single regional soils database, in contrast to a range of pedotransfer
  functions derived from local databases with measurement sets that may have limited
  transferability. The pedotransfer function generation was based on a machine learning
  algorithm incorporating the Generalized Linear Mixed Model with interactions and
  nested terms, with Residual Maximum Likelihood estimation, and a predictor-frequency
  ranking system with step-wise reduction of predictors to evaluate the predictive
  errors in reduced models. The source of the data was the Victorian Soil Information
  System (VSIS), which is a database administered for soil information and mapping
  purposes. The database contains soil measurements and information from locations
  across Victoria and is a repository of historical data, including monitoring studies.
  In total, data from 93 projects were available for inputs to modelling and analysis,
  with 5158 samples used to derive predictors for EC and 1954 samples used to derive
  predictors for OC. Over 500 models were tested by systematically reducing the number
  of predictors from the full model. Five-fold cross-validation was used for estimation
  of model mean-squared prediction error (MSPE) and mean-absolute percentage error
  (MAPE). The results were statistically significant with only a gradual reduction
  in error for the top-ranked 50 models. The prediction errors (MSPE and MAPE) of
  the top ranked model for EC are 0.686 and 0.635, and 0.413 and 0.474 for OC respectively.
  The four most frequently occurring predictors both for EC and OC prediction across
  the full set of models were found to be soil depth, pH, particle size distribution
  and geomorphological mapping unit. The possible advantages and disadvantages of
  this approach were discussed with respect to other machine learning approaches.

abstract: "The process of cleaning motion capture data of aberrant points has been\
  \ described as \u201Cthe bane of motion capture operators\u201D. Yet, managing the\
  \ high volume kinematic data generated through in-home neurogames requires data\
  \ quality control that, executed insufficiently, jeopardizes accuracy of outcomes.\
  \ To begin to address this issue at the intersection of biomechanics and \u201C\
  big data\u201D, we performed a secondary analysis of a neurogame, evaluating gesture\
  \ count as well as shoulder and elbow joint angle outcomes calculated from kinematic\
  \ data in which valid gestures were identified through 3 methods: visual review\
  \ of regions of interest by an expert (BP); manufacturer-recommended data smoothing\
  \ (MS); and automated methods (AI). We hypothesized that upper extremity kinematic\
  \ outcomes from BP would be matched by AI but not MS methods. From one person with\
  \ post-stroke hemiparesis, upper-extremity kinematic data were collected for 6\_\
  days over 2\_weeks using a Microsoft Kinect\u2122-based neurogame. We calculated\
  \ gesture count, shoulder angle, and elbow angle outcomes from data managed using\
  \ BP, MS, and AI methods. BP identified 1929 valid gestures total over 6\_days which\
  \ was different than the other two methods (p\_=\_0.0015). In contrast, the AI algorithm\
  \ with best precision identified 4372 and MS identified 4459 valid gestures. Furthermore,\
  \ angle outcomes calculated from AI and MS methods resulted in different values\
  \ than BP (p\_<\_0.001 for 5 of 6 variables). More research is needed to automate\
  \ treatment of high volume, low quality motion data to support investigation of\
  \ motion associated with in-home rehabilitation neurogames."

abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), a method of transcriptome sequencing
  at the single-cell level, has recently emerged as a revolutionary technology in
  the field of biomedical research. Compared to conventional gene expression profiling
  in bulk, scRNA-seq resolves biological differences among individual cells and enables
  the identification of rare cell populations that are easily overlooked. This review
  introduces the method of scRNA-seq, summarizes its applications in the field of
  cardiovascular disease research, and discusses existing limitations and prospects
  for future applications.

abstract: "Aims\nThe accurate identification of mothers at risk of postpartum psychiatric\
  \ admission would allow for preventive intervention or more timely admission. We\
  \ developed a prediction model to identify women at risk of postpartum psychiatric\
  \ admission.\nMethods\nData included administrative health data of all inpatient\
  \ live births in the Australian state of Queensland between January 2009 and October\
  \ 2014. Analyses were restricted to mothers with one or more indicator of mental\
  \ health problems during pregnancy (n\_=\_75,054 births). The predictors included\
  \ all maternal data up to and including the delivery, and neonatal data recorded\
  \ at delivery. We used multiple machine learning methods to predict hospital admission\
  \ in the 12 months following delivery in which the primary diagnosis was recorded\
  \ as an ICD-10 psychotic, bipolar or depressive disorders.\nResults\nThe boosted\
  \ trees algorithm produced the best performing model, predicting postpartum psychiatric\
  \ admission in the validation data with good discrimination [AUC\_=\_0.80; 95% CI\
  \ = (0.76, 0.83)] and achieving good calibration. This model outperformed benchmark\
  \ logistic regression model and an elastic net model. In addition to indicators\
  \ of maternal metal health history, maternal and neonatal anthropometric measures\
  \ and social/lifestyle factors were strong predictors.\nConclusion\nOur results\
  \ indicate the potential of a big data approach when aiming to identify mothers\
  \ at risk of postpartum psychiatric admission. Mothers at risk could be followed-up\
  \ and supported after neonatal discharge to either remove the need for admission\
  \ or facilitate more timely admission."

abstract: As more and more health systems have converted to the use of electronic
  health records, the amount of searchable and analyzable data is exploding. This
  includes not just provider or laboratory created data but also data collected by
  instruments, personal devices, and patients themselves, among others. This has led
  to more attention being paid to the analysis of these data to answer previously
  unaddressed questions. This is especially important given the number of therapies
  previously found to be beneficial in clinical trials that are currently being re-scrutinized.
  Because there are orders of magnitude more information contained in these data sets,
  a fundamentally different approach needs to be taken to their processing and analysis
  and the generation of knowledge. Health care and medicine are drivers of this phenomenon
  and will ultimately be the main beneficiaries. Concurrently, many different types
  of questions can now be asked using these data sets. Research groups have become
  increasingly active in mining large data sets, including nationwide health care
  databases, to learn about associations of medication use and various unrelated diseases
  such as cancer. Given the recent increase in research activity in this area, its
  promise to radically change clinical research, and the relative lack of widespread
  knowledge about its potential and advances, we surveyed the available literature
  to understand the strengths and limitations of these new tools. We also outline
  new databases and techniques that are available to researchers worldwide, with special
  focus on work pertaining to the broad and rapid monitoring of drug safety and secondary
  effects.

abstract: "Shales are a class of multiscale, multiphase, hybrid inorganic-organic\
  \ composite materials exhibiting both frictional and cohesive behavior, and it is\
  \ very challenging to characterize and interpret their complex mechanical properties.\
  \ A statistical nanoindentation approach with pertinent viable data analytics was\
  \ developed to probe the mechanical properties of shales across different length\
  \ scales. Grid nanoindentation experiments with continuous stiffness measurement\
  \ performed on shales to relatively large depths of 6\u20138\_\xB5m obtained massive\
  \ data, which were processed by the new data analytics: segmentation at selected\
  \ depths of a great number (e.g., >500) of continuous Young's modulus versus indentation\
  \ depth curves obtained from unknown constituent phases yielded multiple discretized\
  \ sub-datasets that were processed to extract individual phases\u2019 elastic moduli\
  \ at respective segmentation depths via probability density function (PDF)-based\
  \ deconvolution; these depth-dependent Young's moduli of each phase were then fitted\
  \ by a newly proposed surround effect model, leading to determination of the properties\
  \ of both individual phases at the nano/micro-scales (i.e., virtually infinitesimal\
  \ depths) and the bulk rock at the macroscale (i.e., ~10\u2013100\_\xB5m depths).\
  \ A significant advantage of this massive data-based indentation approach is that\
  \ the mechanical properties of composite materials such as shales can be probed\
  \ across different scales by a single measurement technique. In addition, a new\
  \ criterion, termed Bin Size Index, was formulated for selecting depth-dependent,\
  \ rational, optimized bin sizes for PDF construction. For the studied shales, results\
  \ show that five mechanically-distinct phases are discerned, including a virtual\
  \ interface phase between hard and soft constituents accounting for a majority of\
  \ indents. Coincidently, the Young's modulus of the bulk rock is nearly the same\
  \ as that of the interface phase, suggesting that the macroscopic properties of\
  \ similar composites may be estimated from measurements on the interface of two\
  \ phases with contrasting mechanical properties. Finally, this approach can guide\
  \ the selection of appropriate indentation depths to probe the mechanical properties\
  \ of both highly heterogeneous bulk materials at the macroscale and their individual\
  \ constituent phases at the nano/micro-scale."

abstract: 'With the wide adoption of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
  by cognitive neuroscience researchers, large volumes of brain imaging data have
  been accumulated in recent years. Aggregating these data to derive scientific insights
  often faces the challenge that fMRI data are high-dimensional, heterogeneous across
  people, and noisy. These challenges demand the development of computational tools
  that are tailored both for the neuroscience questions and for the properties of
  the data. We review a few recently developed algorithms in various domains of fMRI
  research: fMRI in naturalistic tasks, analyzing full-brain functional connectivity,
  pattern classification, inferring representational similarity and modeling structured
  residuals. These algorithms all tackle the challenges in fMRI similarly: they start
  by making clear statements of assumptions about neural data and existing domain
  knowledge, incorporate those assumptions and domain knowledge into probabilistic
  graphical models, and use those models to estimate properties of interest or latent
  structures in the data. Such approaches can avoid erroneous findings, reduce the
  impact of noise, better utilize known properties of the data, and better aggregate
  data across groups of subjects. With these successful cases, we advocate wider adoption
  of explicit model construction in cognitive neuroscience. Although we focus on fMRI,
  the principle illustrated here is generally applicable to brain data of other modalities.'

abstract: "Existing logo detection methods usually consider a small number of logo\

  \ self-discovering informative training images from noisy web data for progressively\
  \ improving model capability in a cross-model co-learning manner. Moreover, we introduce\
  \ a very large (2,190,757 images of 194 logo classes) logo dataset \u201CWebLogo-2M\u201D\
  \ by designing an automatic data collection and processing method. Extensive comparative\

abstract: Petrographic analysis based on microfacies identification in thin sections
  is widely used in sedimentary environment interpretation and paleoecological reconstruction.
  Fossil recognition from microfacies is an essential procedure for petrographers
  to complete this task. Distinguishing the morphological and microstructural diversity
  of skeletal fragments requires extensive prior knowledge of fossil morphotypes in
  microfacies and long training sessions under the microscope. This requirement engenders
  certain challenges for sedimentologists and paleontologists, especially novices.
  However, a machine classifier can help address this challenge. In this study, we
  collected a microfacies image dataset comprising both public data from 1133 references
  and our own materials (including a total of 30,815 images of 22 fossil and abiotic
  grain groups). We employed a high-performance workstation to implement four classic
  deep convolutional neural networks, which have proven to be highly efficient in
  computer vision. Our framework uses a transfer learning technique, which reuses
  the pre-trained parameters that are trained on a larger ImageNet dataset as initialization
  for the network to achieve high accuracy with low computing costs. We obtained up
  to 95% of the top one and 99% of the top three test accuracies in the Inception
  ResNet v2 architecture. The machine classifier exhibited 0.99 precision on minerals
  such as dolomite and pyrite. Although it had some difficulty on samples having similar
  morphologies, such as bivalve, brachiopod, and ostracod, it nevertheless obtained
  0.88 precision. Our machine learning framework demonstrates high accuracy with reproducibility
  and bias avoidance that is comparable to those of human classifiers. Its application
  can thus eliminate much of the tedious, manually intensive efforts by human experts
  conducting routine identification.

abstract: "The high-speed rail (HSR) of China has developed and expanded rapidly and\
  \ made great achievements in the past twenty years. The ongoing HSR plan is expected\
  \ to have a significant impact on the urban economy and spatial structure in China.\
  \ However, relevant data-driven research is still lacking. Traditional data collection\
  \ approaches such as field surveys are costly to assure the accuracy of materials.\
  \ In this study, a new remote sensing perspective of night-time light (NTL) was\
  \ adopted to observe the long-term impact of the HSR on cities along the rail. More\
  \ specifically, we investigated the impact of the Beijing\u2013Guangzhou High-Speed\
  \ Railway (BGHSR) on urban economic development by using night-time light data from\
  \ 2002 to 2018. Such a line connects the capital (located in the north of China)\
  \ and southern China and lies on the most important geographic axis of the country.\
  \ Our results find that the construction of BGHSR line has a considerable positive\
  \ impact on economies of first-tier cities (e.g., Beijing and Guangzhou) and new-first-tier\
  \ cities (e.g., Zhengzhou, Wuhan, and Changsha), but also hurt some second-tier\
  \ and third-tier cities such as Baoding and Handan. Generally, the spatial economic\
  \ pattern of cities along the BGHSR line has been rapidly reshaped with the change\
  \ of the transportation system. Each city needs to reconsider its role and value\
  \ in the coming regionalization process to adapt to the national strategy."

abstract: The interrogation of established, large-scale datasets presents great opportunities
  in health data science for the linkage and mining of potentially disparate resources
  to create new knowledge in a fast and cost-efficient manner. The number of datasets
  that can be queried in the field of multimorbidity is vast, ranging from national
  administrative and audit datasets, large clinical, technical and biological cohorts,
  through to more bespoke data collections made available by individual organisations
  and laboratories. However, with these opportunities also come technical and regulatory
  challenges that require an informed approach. In this review, we outline the potential
  benefits of using previously collected data as a vehicle for research activity.
  We illustrate the added value of combining potentially disparate datasets to find
  answers to novel questions in the field. We focus on the legal, governance and logistical
  considerations required to hold and analyse data acquired from disparate sources
  and outline some of the solutions to these challenges. We discuss the infrastructure
  resources required and the essential considerations in data curation and informatics
  management, and briefly discuss some of the analysis approaches currently used.

abstract: "Long-term mechanistic research and monitoring provides integral science\
  \ support for ecosystem-based management (EBM) of resources, activities and services.\
  \ Decades of oceanographic and ecological research by Bill Peterson and colleagues\
  \ along the Newport Hydrographic Line (NH Line) provides essential context for understanding\
  \ and managing Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. and other marine resources in the\
  \ California Current ecosystem. This research program helped federal scientists\
  \ convey the significance of the northeast Pacific marine heatwave (2013\u20132016)\

  \ for Pacific salmon and other consumers. We identify six traits of the dataset\
  \ produced by Peterson and colleagues that have made it especially valuable for\
  \ informing management: (i) it has generated robust ecosystem indicators; (ii) it\
  \ is long-term; (iii) it is associated with meaningful ecological mechanisms; (iv)\

abstract: Pediatric cancer is a rare disease with a low annual incidence, which presents
  a significant challenge in being able to collect enough data to fuel clinical discoveries.
  Big data registry trials hold promise to advance the study of pediatric cancers
  by allowing for the combination of traditional randomized controlled trials with
  the power of larger cohort sizes. The emergence of big data resources and data-sharing
  initiatives are becoming transformative for pediatric cancer diagnosis and treatment.
  This review discusses the uses of big data in pediatric cancer, existing pediatric
  cancer registry initiatives and research, the challenges in harmonizing these data
  to improve accessibility for study, and building pediatric data commons and other
  important future endeavors.

abstract: Faculty learning communities (FLCs) are year-long professional development
  opportunities available at many higher education institutions in the United States.
  While the literature reflects some librarian engagement with FLCs, it seems limited
  primarily to areas of traditional librarian expertise such as information literacy
  and outreach. This article describes a case study of a librarian-facilitated FLC
  focused on data literacy, which resulted in the development of a teaching toolkit,
  library-led data literacy instruction, and ongoing collaborations between librarians
  and faculty. The FLC structure proved to be a valuable framework that facilitated
  collaborative learning in topics relevant to both disciplinary faculty and librarians.
  In addition, the tangible work products produced by the FLC serve to advance the
  strategic, curricular goals of the university while giving the library an opportunity
  to showcase its value in the academic lifecycle.

abstract: This paper presents a hybrid deep forest approach for outlier detection
  and fault diagnosis. Isolation forest algorithm is combined with Pearson's correlation
  coefficient for outlier detection. The physical significance of outliers detected
  by the proposed algorithm is explained by origin analysis, which is rarely mentioned
  in existing studies. In addition, a novel non-neural network deep learning model-cascade
  forest model is proposed to fault diagnosis of HVAC system for the first time to
  achieve high precision accuracy in low-dimensional features. The proposed approach
  is validated with the refrigerant charge fault of VRF system. The results show that
  the isolation forest algorithm can improve the performance of fault diagnosis model
  and the mainly outliers of VRF system are defrosting data. The IF-CF model has short
  operation time, and high accuracy in low-dimensional features. When the dimension
  drops to 6, the accuracy of the IF-CF model is 94.16%, which is 5.26%, 10.02%, 5.87%
  and 3.34% higher than the IF-MLP, IF-BPNN, IF-SVM and IF-LSTM models, respectively.
  Moreover, IF-CF model does not require complex hyper-parameter optimization strategy
  because its maximum accuracy difference in different hyper-parameters is 2.04%.
  This study is enlightening which may inspire the potential of outlier detection
  technology and deep learning in HVAC field.

abstract: Web services playing a vital role in the World Wide Web and generates huge
  amount of information across various domains of internet. Due to this evolution
  data in the form of articles, reports, digital galleries and web data of companies
  were increased everyday. To handle the huge volume of data each and every day, automatic
  query classification based on internet is more significant method. Research and
  development community has developed various techniques for the web services discovery,
  where it offers the mandated data for the improvement method. With respect to the
  literature survey, most of the researchers are concentrating to provide the efficient
  web service discovery. The amount of data that is available in the web is keeps
  on increasing and also it is used to differentiate the services, explanation and
  work of art. In order to achieve this method, machine learning algorithm is applied
  extensively for domain categorization. Various machine learning algorithm like KNN
  is applied for web service discovery. The systems are effectively learning the input
  and evaluate the performance accuracy with the given datasets. This paper, proposes
  an improved fuzzy with KNN algorithm for effective web service classification. This
  is used to increase an outcome in the form of accuracy and performance measures.

abstract: "Density log data is one of the key physical attributes used for reservoir\
  \ characterization by quantifying and qualifying lithological attributes in a wellbore.\
  \ The density log is most often acquired by geophysical wireline logging techniques\
  \ after drilling. However, wireline logging can be difficult to execute in highly\
  \ deviated wells and alternative data acquisition such as logging-while-drilling\
  \ (LWD) can be very costly. This paper describes the process of using instantaneous\
  \ drilling attributes together with a machine learning algorithm, extreme gradient\
  \ boosting (XGBoost), to generate a pseudo density log. The mean absolute error\
  \ (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) are used as the evaluation metrics. Case\
  \ studies are performed using data from six coalbed methane (or coal seam gas) wells\
  \ in the Surat Basin, Australia. The inputs include drilling data [weight on bit\
  \ (WOB), rotations per minute (RPM), torque, true vertical depth (TVD) and rate\
  \ of penetration (ROP)] and LWD data (i.e., natural gamma ray and hole diameter).\
  \ The MAE of pseudo density log for most wells is between 0.08 and 0.11\_g/cc (except\
  \ Well 4 is 0.16\_g/cc), which results in an average error rate less than 5%. It\
  \ is found that TVD, gamma ray, ROP, and hole diameter are four most important features.\
  \ Further experiment shows that the model with these four important features has\
  \ almost the same performance as the model with all features. The proposed machine\
  \ learning methodology can assist petroleum engineers and geologists in reservoir\
  \ characterization by generating pseudo density logs from ongoing LWD and drilling\
  \ data in real time. It can potentially mitigate the need to run wireline logging\
  \ tools after drilling or costly LWD techniques whilst drilling."

abstract: Individualizing patient treatment is a core objective of the medical field.
  Reaching this objective has been elusive owing to the complex set of factors contributing
  to both disease and health; many factors, from genes to proteins, remain unknown
  in their role in human physiology. Accurately diagnosing, monitoring, and treating
  disorders requires advances in biomarker discovery, the subsequent development of
  accurate signatures that correspond with dynamic disease states, as well as therapeutic
  interventions that can be continuously optimized and modulated for dose and drug
  selection. This work highlights key breakthroughs in the development of enabling
  technologies that further the goal of personalized and precision medicine, and remaining
  challenges that, when addressed, may forge unprecedented capabilities in realizing
  truly individualized patient care.

abstract: Big data are no longer an obstacle; now, by using artificial intelligence
  (AI), previously undiscovered knowledge can be found in massive data collections.
  The radiation oncology clinic daily produces a large amount of multisource data
  and metadata during its routine clinical and research activities. These data involve
  multiple stakeholders and users. Because of a lack of interoperability, most of
  these data remain unused, and powerful insights that could improve patient care
  are lost. Changing the paradigm by introducing powerful AI analytics and a common
  vision for empowering big data in radiation oncology is imperative. However, this
  can only be achieved by creating a clinical data science community in radiation
  oncology. In this work, we present why such a community is needed to translate multisource
  data into clinical decision aids.

abstract: Over the past ten years, plant phenotyping technologies that utilize sensing
  and data mining approaches to estimate crop traits in a high-throughput and objective
  manner, have been evaluated and applied in different crop improvement and breeding
  programs. Multiple platforms, from proximal to unmanned aerial systems based remote
  sensing, have been developed and applied to increase the throughput, efficiency,
  and objectivity during field phenotyping. In recent years, the development and availability
  of high-resolution satellite imagery from low-orbit satellites have offered yet
  another opportunity for phenotyping applications. This review demonstrates the applications
  of satellite imagery in agricultural production and crop phenotyping and suggests
  plant traits that can be evaluated using high-resolution satellite imagery. The
  review summarizes the merits (e.g. rapid/automated data capture from larger and
  multiple field sites) and challenges (e.g. cloud occlusion) of satellite-based phenotyping
  in crop breeding programs, and discusses future perspectives/opportunities of high-resolution
  satellite imagery as a phenotyping tool. High-resolution satellite imagery can serve
  as a phenotyping tool for the assessment of crop varieties, thus assisting plants
  breeders in the process of selecting high-yielding, stress (abiotic and biotic)
  tolerant variety that can contribute to addressing world food demand amidst climate
  change.

abstract: With a growing demand for accurate ion beam analysis on a large number of
  samples, it becomes an issue of how to ensure the quality standards and consistency
  over hundreds or thousands of samples. In this sense, a virtual assistant that checks
  the data quality, emitting certificates of quality, is highly desired. Even the
  processing of a massive number of spectra is a problem regarding the consistency
  of the analysis. In this work, we report the design and first results of a virtual
  layer under implementation in our laboratory. It consists of a series of systems
  running in the cloud that perform the mentioned tasks and serves as a virtual assistant

abstract: We describe a strategy for applying multilevel regression and post-stratification
  (MRP) methods to pre-election polling. Using a combination of contemporaneous polling,
  census data, past election polling, past election results, and other sources of
  information, we are able to construct probabilistic, internally consistent estimates
  of national votes and the sub-national electoral districts that determine seats
  or electoral votes in many electoral systems. We report on the performance of the
  general framework in three applications that were conducted and released publicly
  in advance of the 2016 UK Referendum on EU Membership, the 2016 US Presidential
  Election, and the 2017 UK General Election.

abstract: "Introduction\nUntil the recent approval of immunotherapy after completing\
  \ concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), there has been little progress in treating\
  \ unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This prompted us to\
  \ search real-world data (RWD) to better understand diagnosis and treatment patterns,\
  \ and outcomes.\nMethods\nThis non-interventional observational study used a unique,\
  \ novel algorithm for big data analysis to collect and assess anonymized patient\
  \ electronic medical records from a clinical data warehouse (CDW) over a 10-year\
  \ period to capture real-world patterns of diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of\
  \ stage III NSCLC patients. We describe real-world patterns of diagnosis and treatment\
  \ of patients with newly-diagnosed stage III NSCLC, and patients\u2019 characteristics,\
  \ and assessment of treatment outcomes.\nResults\nWe analyzed clinical variables\
  \ from 23,735 NSCLC patients. Stage III patients (N\u202F=\u202F4138, 18.2 %) were\
  \ diagnosed as IIIA (N\u202F=\u202F2,547, 11.2 %) or IIIB (N\u202F=\u202F1,591.\
  \ 7.0 %). Treated stage III patients (N\u202F=\u202F2530, 61.1 %) had a median age\
  \ of 64.2 years, were mostly male (78.5 %) and had an ECOG performance status of\
  \ 1 (65.2 %). Treatment comprised curative-intent surgery (N\u202F=\u202F1,254,\
  \ 49.6 %) with 705 receiving neoadjuvant therapy; definitive CRT (N\u202F=\u202F\
  648, 25.6 %); palliative CT (N\u202F=\u202F270, 10.7 %), or thoracic RT (N\u202F\
  =\u202F170, 6.7 %). Median OS (range) for neoadjuvant, surgery, CRT, palliative\
  \ chemotherapy, lung RT alone, and supportive care was 49.2 (42.0\u201356.5), 52.5\
  \ (43.1\u201361.9), 30.3 (26.6\u201334.0), 14.7 (13.0\u201316.4), 8.8 (6.2\u2013\
  11.3), and 2.0 (1.0\u20133.0) months, respectively.\nConclusions\nThis unique in-house\
  \ algorithm enabled a rapid and comprehensive analysis of big data through a CDW,\
  \ with daily automatic updates that documented real-world PFS and OS consistent\
  \ with the published literature, and real-world treatment patterns and clinical\
  \ outcomes in stage III NSCLC patients."

abstract: In recent years, the wealth of technological development revolutionised
  our ability to collect data in geosciences. Due to the unprecedented level of detail
  of these datasets, geomorphologists are facing new challenges, giving more in-depth
  answers to a broad(er) range of fundamental questions across the full spectrum of
  the Earth's (and Planetary) processes. This contribution builds on the existing
  literature of geomorphometry (the science of quantitative land-surface analysis)
  and feature extraction (translate land surface parameters into extents of geomorphological
  elements). It provides evidence of critical themes as well as emerging fields of
  future research in the digital realm, supporting the likely effectiveness of geomorphometry
  and feature extractions as they are advancing the theoretical, empirical and applied
  dimension of geomorphology. The review further discusses the role of geomorphometric
  legacies, and scientific reproducibility, and how they can be implemented, in the
  hope that this will facilitate action towards improving the transparency, and efficiency
  of scientific research, and accelerate discoveries in geomorphology. In the current
  landscape, substantial changes in landforms, ecosystems, land use, hydrological
  routing, and direct anthropogenic modifications impact systems across the full spectrum
  of geomorphological processes. Although uncertainties in the precise nature and
  likelihood of changes exist, geomorphometry and feature extraction can aid exploring
  process regimes and landscape responses. Taken together, they can revolutionise
  geomorphology by opening the doors to improved investigations crossing space and
  time scales, blurring the boundaries between traditional approaches and computer
  modelling, and facilitating cross-disciplinary research. Ultimately, the exploitation
  of the available wealth of digital information can help to translate our understanding
  of geomorphic processes, which is often based on observations of past or current
  conditions, into the rapidly changing future.

abstract: 'Introduction

  The public-private ADVANCE consortium (Accelerated development of vaccine benefit-risk
  collaboration in Europe) aimed to assess if electronic healthcare databases can
  provide fit-for purpose data for collaborative, distributed studies and monitoring
  of vaccine coverage, benefits and risks of vaccines.

  Objective

  To evaluate if European healthcare databases can be used to estimate vaccine coverage,
  benefit and/or risk using pertussis-containing vaccines as an example.

  Methods

  Characterisation was conducted using open-source Java-based (Jerboa) software and
  R scripts. We obtained: (i) The general characteristics of the database and data
  source (meta-data) and (ii) a detailed description of the database population (size,
  representatively of age/sex of national population, rounding of birth dates, delay
  between birth and database entry), vaccinations (number of vaccine doses, recording
  of doses, pattern of doses by age and coverage) and events of interest (diagnosis
  codes, incidence rates). A total of nine databases (primary care, regional/national
  record linkage) provided data on events (pertussis, pneumonia, death, fever, convulsions,
  injection site reactions, hypotonic hypo-responsive episode, persistent crying)
  and vaccines (acellular pertussis and whole cell pertussis) related to the pertussis
  proof of concept studies.

  Results

  The databases contained data for a total population of 44 million individuals. Seven
  databases had recorded doses of vaccines. The pertussis coverage estimates were
  similar to those reported by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Incidence rates
  of events were comparable in magnitude and age-distribution between databases with
  the same characteristics. Several conditions (persistent crying and somnolence)
  were not captured by the databases for which outcomes were restricted to hospital
  discharge diagnoses.

  Conclusion

  The database characterisation programs and workflows allowed for an efficient, transparent
  and standardised description and verification of electronic healthcare databases
  which may participate in pertussis vaccine coverage, benefit and risk studies. This
  approach is ready to be used for other vaccines/events to create readiness for participation
  in other vaccine related studies.'

abstract: By analyzing the dynamic behavior of institutional and retail investors
  in the Indonesia Stock Exchange using their completed transactions (comprising over
  250 million observations), this study highlights that their trading strategies and
  behavior, in which institutions play a more important role than individuals in the
  market, are indeed different. Specifically, past trading activities by individual
  (institutional) investors have significantly affected the current trading behaviors
  and strategies of individual investors (both investor types). Furthermore, retail
  (institutional) investors are most likely to perform contrarian (momentum) strategies
  and trade frequently (infrequently) with small (large) amounts of money and short
  (long) holding periods.

abstract: "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder\
  \ amongst women of reproductive age, whose aetiology remains unclear. To improve\
  \ our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease, we conducted\
  \ a genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in granulosa lutein cells collected from\
  \ 16 women suffering from PCOS, in comparison to 16 healthy controls. Samples were\
  \ collected by follicular aspiration during routine egg collection for IVF treatment.\
  \ Study groups were matched for age and BMI, did not suffer from other disease and\
  \ were not taking confounding medication. Comparing women with polycystic versus\
  \ normal ovarian morphology, after correcting for multiple comparisons, we identified\
  \ 106 differentially methylated CpG sites with p-values <5.8\u202F\xD7\u202F10\u2212\
  8 that were associated with 88 genes, several of which are known to relate either\
  \ to PCOS or to ovarian function. Replication and validation of the experiment was\
  \ done using pyrosequencing to analyse six of the identified differentially methylated\
  \ sites. Pathway analysis indicated potential disruption in canonical pathways and\
  \ gene networks that are, amongst other, associated with cancer, cardiogenesis,\
  \ Hedgehog signalling and immune response. In conclusion, these novel findings indicate\
  \ that women with PCOS display epigenetic changes in ovarian granulosa cells that\
  \ may be associated with the heterogeneity of the disorder."

abstract: "In its traditional definition, a repair of an inconsistent database is\
  \ a consistent database that differs from the inconsistent one in a \u201Cminimal\
  \ way.\u201D Often, repairs are not equally legitimate, as it is desired to prefer\
  \ one over another; for example, one fact is regarded more reliable than another,\
  \ or a more recent fact should be preferred to an earlier one. Motivated by these\
  \ considerations, researchers have introduced and investigated the framework of\
  \ preferred repairs, in the context of denial constraints and subset repairs. There,\
  \ a priority relation between facts is lifted towards a priority relation between\
  \ consistent databases, and repairs are restricted to the ones that are optimal\
  \ in the lifted sense. Three notions of lifting (and preferred repairs) have been\
  \ proposed: Pareto, global, and completion. In this article, we investigate the\
  \ complexity of three problems on preferred repairs. The first is the problem of\
  \ deciding whether the priority relation contains enough information to clean the\
  \ database unambiguously, or in other words, whether there is exactly one preferred\
  \ repair. We show that the different lifting semantics entail highly different complexities\
  \ for this problem. Then, we study the ability to quantify ambiguity, by investigating\
  \ two classes of problems. The first is that of counting the preferred repairs.\
  \ We establish a dichotomy in data complexity for the entire space of (sets of)\
  \ functional dependencies for all three notions. The second class of problems is\
  \ that of enumerating (i.e., generating) the preferred repairs. We devise enumeration\
  \ algorithms with efficiency guarantees on the delay between generated repairs,\
  \ even for constraints represented as general conflict graphs or hypergraphs."

abstract: This paper proposes an integrative approach to feature (input and output)
  selection in Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The DEA model is enriched with zero-one
  decision variables modelling the selection of features, yielding a Mixed Integer
  Linear Programming formulation. This single-model approach can handle different
  objective functions as well as constraints to incorporate desirable properties from
  the real-world application. Our approach is illustrated on the benchmarking of electricity
  Distribution System Operators (DSOs). The numerical results highlight the advantages
  of our single-model approach provide to the user, in terms of making the choice
  of the number of features, as well as modeling their costs and their nature.

abstract: "Introduction\nRecent advances in burn care have resulted in the transition\
  \ of care from inpatient to outpatient. There is a growing appreciation that with\
  \ improved survival, meaningful markers of quality need to include recovery of form,\
  \ function, and reconstruction. Capture of the data describing care delivered in\
  \ the outpatient setting is being missed.\nMethods\nDevelopment of our outpatient\
  \ database included providers, registrar, program manager, and outpatient nursing\
  \ staff. Data points were included if they described the population, and epidemiology\
  \ of our patients, were useful for programmatic changes and improvements as well\
  \ as anticipated research focus areas.\nResults\nThe database platform chosen was\
  \ Midas+\u2122 because it was in use by hospital quality and integrated with the\
  \ electronic medical record. Fields were customized based on changing program needs\
  \ and are updated for new programs or outcomes measures. Reports can be easily built\
  \ and both outpatients and inpatients are included. This allows for longitudinal\
  \ tracking of burn patients. Ongoing additions to original data points include variables\
  \ to track outcomes related to laser therapy for scar management, time to custom\
  \ garment donning, and to track functional outcomes. Epidemiologic data collected\
  \ is used to target high-risk populations for prevention and outreach efforts. Outcome\
  \ data is used for evaluation of programs and care.\nConclusions\nHigh quality databases\
  \ serve to measure effectiveness of care and offer insight for areas of improvement.\
  \ There is a clear need for inclusion of outpatient activity in the National Burn\
  \ Registry (NBR)."

abstract: "Big data generated by social media stands for a valuable source of information,\
  \ which offers an excellent opportunity to mine valuable insights. Particularly,\
  \ User-generated contents such as reviews, recommendations, and users\u2019 behavior\
  \ data are useful for supporting several marketing activities of many companies.\
  \ Knowing what users are saying about the products they bought or the services they\
  \ used through reviews in social media represents a key factor for making decisions.\
  \ Sentiment analysis is one of the fundamental tasks in Natural Language Processing.\
  \ Although deep learning for sentiment analysis has achieved great success and allowed\
  \ several firms to analyze and extract relevant information from their textual data,\
  \ but as the volume of data grows, a model that runs in a traditional environment\
  \ cannot be effective, which implies the importance of efficient distributed deep\
  \ learning models for social Big Data analytics. Besides, it is known that social\
  \ media analysis is a complex process, which involves a set of complex tasks. Therefore,\
  \ it is important to address the challenges and issues of social big data analytics\
  \ and enhance the performance of deep learning techniques in terms of classification\
  \ accuracy to obtain better decisions. In this paper, we propose an approach for\
  \ sentiment analysis, which is devoted to adopting fastText with Recurrent neural\
  \ network variants to represent textual data efficiently. Then, it employs the new\
  \ representations to perform the classification task. Its main objective is to enhance\
  \ the performance of well-known Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) variants in terms\
  \ of classification accuracy and handle large scale data. In addition, we propose\
  \ a distributed intelligent system for real-time social big data analytics. It is\
  \ designed to ingest, store, process, index, and visualize the huge amount of information\
  \ in real-time. The proposed system adopts distributed machine learning with our\
  \ proposed method for enhancing decision-making processes. Extensive experiments\
  \ conducted on two benchmark data sets demonstrate that our proposal for sentiment\
  \ analysis outperforms well-known distributed recurrent neural network variants\
  \ (i.e., Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM),\
  \ and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)). Specifically, we tested the efficiency of our\
  \ approach using the three different deep learning models. The results show that\
  \ our proposed approach is able to enhance the performance of the three models.\
  \ The current work can provide several benefits for researchers and practitioners\
  \ who want to collect, handle, analyze and visualize several sources of information\
  \ in real-time. Also, it can contribute to a better understanding of public opinion\
  \ and user behaviors using our proposed system with the improved variants of the\
  \ most powerful distributed deep learning and machine learning algorithms. Furthermore,\
  \ it is able to increase the classification accuracy of several existing works based\
  \ on RNN models for sentiment analysis."

abstract: "Compulsivity is recognized as a transdiagnostic phenotype, underlying a\
  \ variety of addictive and obsessive\u2013compulsive behaviors. However, current\
  \ understanding of how it should be operationalized and the processes contributing\
  \ to its development and maintenance is limited. The present study investigated\
  \ if there was a relationship between the affective process Experiential Avoidance\
  \ (EA), an unwillingness to tolerate negative internal experiences, and the frequency\
  \ and severity of transdiagnostic compulsive behaviors. A large sample of adults\
  \ (N\_=\_469) completed online questionnaires measuring EA, psychological distress\
  \ and the severity of seven obsessive\u2013compulsive and addiction-related behaviors.\
  \ Using structural equation modelling, results indicated a one-factor model of compulsivity\
  \ was superior to the two-factor model (addictive- vs OCD-related behaviors). The\
  \ effect of EA on compulsivity was fully mediated by psychological distress, which\
  \ in turn had a strong direct effect on compulsivity. This suggests distress is\
  \ a key mechanism in explaining why people with high EA are more prone to compulsive\
  \ behaviors. The final model explained 41% of the variance in compulsivity, underscoring\
  \ the importance of these constructs as likely risk and maintenance factors for\
  \ compulsive behavior. Implications for designing effective psychological interventions\
  \ for compulsivity are discussed."

abstract: "One of the most relevant inputs for hydrological modeling is the soil map.\
  \ The soil sources and scales for the soil properties are diverse, and the quality\
  \ of soil mapping is increasing, but soil surveying is time-consuming and large\
  \ area campaigns are expensive. The taxonomic unit approach for soil mapping is\
  \ common and limited to one layer of data. This limitation causes errors in simulated\
  \ water fluxes through the soil when taxonomic units approach is implemented during\
  \ hydrological modeling analysis. Some strategies using geostatistics and machine\
  \ learning algorithms such as Kriging and Self-Organizing maps (SOM) are improving\
  \ the taxonomic units\u2019 approach and could serve as an alternative for soil\
  \ mapping for hydrological purposes. The aim of this work is to study the influence\
  \ of different soil maps and resolutions on the main hydrological components of\
  \ a sub-arid watershed in central Spain. For this, the Soil Water and Assessment\
  \ Tool (SWAT) was parameterized with three different soil maps. A first one was\
  \ based on Harmonized World Soil database from FAO, at scale 1:1,000,000 (HWSD).\
  \ The other two were based on a Kriging interpolation at 100\_\xD7\_100 m from soil\
  \ samples. To obtain soil properties map from it, two strategies were applied: one\
  \ was to average the soil properties following the official taxonomic soil units\
  \ at 1:400,000 scale (Agricultural Technological Institute of Castilla and Leon\
  \ - ITACyL) and the other was to applied Self-organizing map (SOM) to create the\
  \ soil units (SOMM). The results suggest that scale and soil properties mapping\
  \ influence HRU definition, which in turn affects water flow through the soils.\
  \ Statistical metrics of model performance were improved from R2 =0.62 and NSE=0.46\
  \ with HWSD soil map to R2 =0.86 and NSE=0.84 with SOM and similar values were achieved\
  \ during validation. Thus, the SOM is presented as an innovative algorithm applied\
  \ for hydrological modeling with SWAT, significantly increasing the level of model\
  \ accuracy to stream flow in sub-arid watersheds."

abstract: "Saturation pressure is a vital parameter of oil reservoir which can reflect\
  \ the oilfield characteristics and determine the oilfield development process, and\
  \ it is determined by experiments in the laboratory in general. However, there was\
  \ only one well with saturation pressure test in this target reservoir, and it is\
  \ necessary to determine whether this parameter is right or not. In this work, we\
  \ present a new method for quickly determining saturation pressure using machine\
  \ learning algorithms, including random forest regressor (RF), support vector machine\_\
  (SVM), decision trees (DT), and artificial neural network\_(ANN or NN). Using these\
  \ approaches, saturation pressure was obtained by using the initial solution gas-oil\
  \ ratio (GOR), temperature, API gravity and other reservoir-fluid data available\
  \ in the oilfields. Compared with the empirical formula for saturation pressure\
  \ calculation, the calculated result shows that the accuracy given from machine\
  \ learning is higher than that from other formulas at home and abroad, and has a\
  \ good match with the lab test. On the basis of the calculated saturation pressure,\
  \ it can determine whether the reservoir enters into the stage of dissolved gas\
  \ drive or not, which also provides the basis for maintaining the reservoir pressure\
  \ by water injection in advance, rational development decision-making and work over\
  \ measures. This approach above can provide technical guidance for predicting the\
  \ saturation pressure in the development of different kinds of reservoirs, including\
  \ the sandstone reservoirs and carbonate reservoirs."

abstract: Biological entities are involved in intricate and complex interactions,
  in which uncovering the biological information from the network concepts are of
  great significance. Benefiting from the advances of network science and high-throughput
  biomedical technologies, studying the biological systems from network biology has
  attracted much attention in recent years, and networks have long been central to
  our understanding of biological systems, in the form of linkage maps among genotypes,
  phenotypes, and the corresponding environmental factors. In this review, we summarize
  the recent developments of computational network biology, first introducing various
  types of biological networks and network structural properties. We then review the
  network-based approaches, ranging from some network metrics to the complicated machine-learning
  methods, and emphasize how to use these algorithms to gain new biological insights.
  Furthermore, we highlight the application in neuroscience, human disease, and drug
  developments from the perspectives of network science, and we discuss some major
  challenges and future directions. We hope that this review will draw increasing
  interdisciplinary attention from physicists, computer scientists, and biologists.

abstract: This study reviews soil water balance (SWB) model approaches to determine
  crop irrigation requirements and scheduling irrigation adopting the FAO56 method.
  The Kc-ETo approach is discussed with consideration of baseline concepts namely
  standard vs. actual Kc concepts, as well as single and dual Kc approaches. Requirements
  for accurate SWB and appropriate parameterization and calibration are introduced.
  The one-step vs. the two-step computational approaches is discussed before the review
  of the FAO56 method to compute and partition crop evapotranspiration and related
  soil water balance. A brief review on transient state models is also included. Baseline
  information is concluded with a discussion on yields prediction and performance
  indicators related to water productivity. The study is continued with an overview
  on models development and use after publication of FAO24, essentially single Kc
  models, followed by a review on models following FAO56, particularly adopting the
  dual Kc approach. Features of dual Kc modeling approaches are analyzed through a
  few applications of the SWB model SIMDualKc, mainly for derivation of basal and
  single Kc, extending the basal Kc approach to relay intercrop cultivation, assessing
  alternative planting dates, determining beneficial and non-beneficial uses of water
  by an irrigated crop, and assessing the groundwater contribution to crop ET in the
  presence of a shallow water table. The review finally discusses the challenges placed
  to SWB modeling for real time irrigation scheduling, particularly the new modeling
  approaches for large scale multi-users application, use of cloud computing and adopting
  the internet of things (IoT), as well as an improved wireless association of modeling
  with soil and plant sensors. Further challenges refer to the use of remote sensing
  energy balance and vegetation indices to map Kc, ET and crop water and irrigation
  requirements. Trends are expected to change research issues relative to SWB modeling,
  with traditional models mainly used for research while new, fast-responding and
  multi-users models based on cloud and IoT technologies will develop into applications
  to the farm practice. Likely, the Kc-ETo will continue to be used, with ETo from
  gridded networks, re-analysis and other sources, and Kc data available in real time
  from large databases and remote sensing.

abstract: "Yield gaps and water productivity are key indicators to monitor the progress\
  \ towards more sustainable and productive cropping systems. Individual farmers are\
  \ collecting increasing amounts of data (\u2018big data\u2019), which can help monitor\
  \ the process of sustainable intensification at local level. In this study, we build\
  \ upon such data to quantify the magnitude and identify the biophysical and management\
  \ determinants of on-farm yield gaps and water productivity for the main arable\
  \ crops cultivated in the Netherlands. The analysis focused on ware, seed and starch\
  \ potatoes, sugar beet, spring onion, winter wheat and spring barley and covered\
  \ the period 2015\u20132017. A crop modelling approach based on crop coefficients\
  \ (kc) and daily weather data was used to estimate the potential yield (Yp), radiation\
  \ intercepted and potential evapotranspiration (ETP) for each crop. Yield gaps were\
  \ estimated to be ca. 10% of Yp for sugar beet, 25\u201330% of Yp for ware, seed\
  \ and starch potato and spring barley, and 35\u201340% of Yp for spring onion and\
  \ winter wheat. Variation in actual yields was associated with water availability\
  \ in key periods of the growing season as well as with sowing and harvest dates.\
  \ However, the R2 of the fitted regressions was rather low (20\u201349%). Current\
  \ levels of crop water productivity ranged between 13\u202Fkg\u202FDM\u202Fha\u2212\
  1\u202Fmm\u22121 for spring barley, ca. 15 kg\u202FDM\u202Fha\u22121\u202Fmm\u2212\
  1 for seed potato, spring onion and winter wheat, 23\u202Fkg\u202FDM\u202Fha\u2212\
  1\u202Fmm\u22121 for ware potato and ca. 25\u202Fkg\u202FDM\u202Fha\u22121\u202F\
  mm\u22121 for starch potato and sugar beet. These values are about half of their\
  \ potential, but increasing actual water productivity further is restricted by rainfall\
  \ amount and distribution. However, doing so should not be prioritized over reducing\
  \ environmental impacts of these intensive cropping systems in the short-term and\
  \ may require large investments from farm to regional levels in the long-term. Although\
  \ these findings are most relevant to similar cropping systems in NW Europe, the\
  \ underlying methods are generic and can be used to benchmark crop performance in\
  \ other cropping systems. Based on this work, we argue that \u2018big data\u2019\
  \ are currently most useful to describe cropping systems at regional scale and derive\
  \ benchmarks of farm performance but not as much to predict and explain crop yield\
  \ variability in time and space."

abstract: "The age of big data analytics is now here, with companies increasingly\
  \ investing in big data initiatives to foster innovation and outperform competition.\
  \ Nevertheless, while researchers and practitioners started to examine the shifts\
  \ that these technologies entail and their overall business value, it is still unclear\
  \ whether and under what conditions they drive innovation. To address this gap,\
  \ this study draws on the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm and information\
  \ governance theory to explore the interplay between a firm\u2019s big data analytics\
  \ capabilities (BDACs) and their information governance practices in shaping innovation\
  \ capabilities. We argue that a firm\u2019s BDAC helps enhance two distinct types\
  \ of innovative capabilities, incremental and radical capabilities, and that information\
  \ governance positively moderates this relationship. To examine our research model,\
  \ we analyzed survey data collected from 175 IT and business managers. Results from\
  \ partial least squares structural equation modelling analysis reveal that BDACs\
  \ have a positive and significant effect on both incremental and radical innovative\
  \ capabilities. Our analysis also highlights the important role of information governance,\
  \ as it positively moderates the relationship between BDAC\u2019s and a firm\u2019\
  s radical innovative capability, while there is a nonsignificant moderating effect\
  \ for incremental innovation capabilities. Finally, we examine the effect of environmental\
  \ uncertainty conditions in our model and find that information governance and BDACs\
  \ have amplified effects under conditions of high environmental dynamism."

abstract: Advanced manufacturing and 3D printing are transformative technologies currently
  undergoing rapid adoption in healthcare, a traditionally non-manufacturing sector.
  Recent development in this field, largely enabled by merging different disciplines,
  has led to important clinical applications from anatomical models to regenerative
  bioscaffolding and devices. Although much research to-date has focussed on materials,
  designs, processes, and products, little attention has been given to the design
  and requirements of facilities for enabling clinically relevant biofabrication solutions.
  These facilities are critical to overcoming the major hurdles to clinical translation,
  including solving important issues such as reproducibility, quality control, regulations,
  and commercialization. To improve process uniformity and ensure consistent development
  and production, large-scale manufacturing of engineered tissues and organs will
  require standardized facilities, equipment, qualification processes, automation,
  and information systems. This review presents current and forward-thinking guidelines
  to help design biofabrication laboratories engaged in engineering model and tissue
  constructs for therapeutic and non-therapeutic applications.

abstract: 'ABSTRACT

  Objectives

  Predictive risk models are advocated in psychosocial oncology practice to provide
  timely and appropriate support to those likely to experience the emotional and psychological
  consequences of cancer and its treatments. New digital technologies mean that large
  scale and routine data collection are becoming part of everyday clinical practice.
  Using these data to try to identify those at greatest risk for late psychosocial
  effects of cancer is an attractive proposition in a climate of unmet need and limited
  resource. In this paper, we present a framework to support the development of high-quality
  predictive risk models in psychosocial and supportive oncology. The aim is to provide
  awareness and increase accessibility of best practice literature to support researchers
  in psychosocial and supportive care to undertake a structured evidence-based approach.

  Data Sources

  Statistical prediction risk model publications.

  Conclusion

  In statistical modeling and data science different approaches are needed if the
  goal is to predict rather than explain. The deployment of a poorly developed and
  tested predictive risk model has the potential to do great harm. Recommendations
  for best practice to develop predictive risk models have been developed but there
  appears to be little application within psychosocial and supportive oncology care.

  Implications for Nursing Practice

  Use of best practice evidence will ensure the development and validation of predictive
  models that are robust as these are currently lacking. These models have the potential
  to enhance supportive oncology care through harnessing routine digital collection
  of patient-reported outcomes and the targeting of interventions according to risk
  characteristics.'

abstract: "Background\nThe volume of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has\
  \ increased dramatically in recent years with good reported long-term outcomes.\
  \ UKA can be performed under general or neuraxial (ie, spinal) anesthesia; however,\
  \ little is known as to whether there is a difference in outcomes based on anesthesia\
  \ type. The purpose of the present study is to compare perioperative outcomes between\
  \ anesthesia types for patients undergoing primary elective UKA.\nMethods\nPatients\
  \ who underwent primary elective UKA from 2007 to 2017 were identified from the\
  \ American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Database.\
  \ Operating room times, length of stay (LOS), 30-day adverse events, and readmission\
  \ rates were compared between patients who received general anesthesia and those\
  \ who received spinal anesthesia. Propensity-adjusted multivariate analysis was\
  \ used to control for selection bias and baseline patient characteristics.\nResults\n\
  A total of 8639 patients underwent UKA and met the inclusion criteria for this study.\
  \ Of these, 4728 patients (54.7%) received general anesthesia and 3911 patients\
  \ (45.3%) received spinal anesthesia. On propensity-adjusted multivariate analyses,\
  \ general anesthesia was associated with increased operative time (P < .001) and\
  \ the occurrence of any severe adverse event (odds ratio [OR], 1.39; 95% confidence\
  \ interval [95% CI], 1.04-1.84; P\_= .024). In addition, general anesthesia was\
  \ associated with higher rates of deep venous thrombosis (OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.11-4.6;\
  \ P\_= .024) and superficial surgical site infection (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.6-1.81;\
  \ P < .001). Finally, general anesthesia was also associated with a reduced likelihood\
  \ of discharge to home (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59-0.88; P < .001). No difference existed\
  \ in postoperative hospital LOS or readmission rates among cohorts.\nConclusion\n\
  General anesthesia was associated with an increased rate of adverse events and increased\
  \ operating room times as well as a reduced likelihood of discharge to home. There\
  \ was no difference in hospital LOS or postoperative readmission rates between anesthesia\
  \ types."

abstract: Benchmarking is a common and effective method for measuring and analyzing
  ICU performance. With the existence of national registries, objective information
  can now be obtained to allow benchmarking of ICU care within and between countries.
  The present manuscript briefly describes the current status of benchmarking in healthcare
  and critical care and presents the LOGIC project, an initiative to promote international
  benchmarking for intensive care units. Currently 13 registries have joined LOGIC.
  We showed large differences in the utilization of ICU as well as resources and in
  outcomes. Despite the need for careful interpretation of differences due to variation
  in definitions and limited risk adjustment, LOGIC is a growing worldwide initiative
  that allows access to insightful epidemiologic data from ICUs in multiple databases
  and registries.

abstract: To comprehensively understand the decision information system for the information
  processing of the intelligent manufacturing under Internet of Things, an intelligent
  decision support system (DSS) based on data mining technology is applied to enterprises
  to establish an Internet of Things-based intelligent DSS for manufacturing industry,
  thereby supporting the decision-makers in making intelligent decisions through the
  intelligent DSS. The research results show that data mining technology can analyze
  the statistical data from multiple angles and perspectives by modeling, classifying,
  and clustering a large amount of data, as well as discovering the correlations between
  the data. Also, in statistical work, the data are counted, and their correlations
  are utilized to support the decision analysis. Therefore, it can be concluded that
  the establishment of intelligent DSS for enterprises in manufacturing industry and
  the utilization of data mining technology as the key technology to achieve the system
  can make the decision-making of the manufacturing enterprises more effective and
  scientific. Eventually, the satisfactory decision-making results can be obtained.

abstract: Advancements in modern mineral processing has been driven by technology
  and fuelled by market economics of supply and demand. Over the last three decades,
  the demand for various minerals has steadily increased, while the mineral processing
  industry has seen an unavoidable increase in the treatment of complex ores, continuous
  decline in plant feed grade and poor plant performance partly due to blending of
  ores with dissimilar properties. Despite these challenges, production plant data
  that are routinely generated are usually underutilised. In this contribution and
  aligned with the direction of the 4th industrial revolution, we highlight the value
  of legacy metallurgical plant data and the concept of a dry laboratory approach.
  This study is presented in two parts. In the current paper (Part I), a comprehensive
  review of the potential for the combination of modern analytical technology with
  data analytics to generate a new competence for process optimisation are provided.
  To demonstrate the value of data within the extractive metallurgy discipline, we
  employ data analytics and simulation to examine gold plant performance and the flotation
  process in two separate case studies in the second paper (Part II). This was done
  with the aim of showcasing relevant plant data insights, and extract parameters
  that should be targeted for plant design and performance optimisation. We identify
  several promising technologies that integrate well with existing mineral processing
  plants and testing laboratories to exploit the concept of a dry laboratory, in order
  to enhance pre-existing mineral processing chains. It also sets the passage in terms
  of the value of innovative analysis of existing and simulation data as part of the
  new world of data analytics. Using data- and technology-driven initiatives, we propose
  the establishment of dry laboratories and data banks to ultimately leverage integrated
  data, analytics and process simulation for effective plant design and improved performance.

abstract: "Global warming may increase the frequency of climate extremes, but systematic\
  \ examinations at different temperature thresholds are unknown over the Tibetan\
  \ Plateau (TP). Changes in surface temperature and precipitation extreme indices\
  \ derived from a multi-model ensemble mean (MMEM) of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison\
  \ Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models are examined under global warming of 1.5\_\xB0\
  C (RCP2.6), 2\_\xB0C (RCP4.5) and 3\_\xB0C (RCP8.5) above pre-industrial levels.\
  \ The TP amplification of future temperature and precipitation changes is evident\
  \ for all three scenarios, with greater trend magnitudes in extreme indices than\
  \ those for the whole China, regions between 25\xB0N and 40\xB0N, Northern Hemisphere\
  \ (land only), Northern Hemisphere and the global mean. The TP amplification is\
  \ also projected to intensify in each scenario, resulting in faster changes in intensity,\
  \ duration and frequency of climate extremes. There appears to be greater difference\
  \ for precipitation-based indices between 2\_\xB0C and 3\_\xB0C than for temperature,\
  \ and the differences between 1.5\_\xB0C and 2\_\xB0C are less dramatic. Overall\
  \ changes in climate extremes at 2\_\xB0C are greater than at 1.5\_\xB0C, but differences\
  \ are less discernible between 3\_\xB0C and 2\_\xB0C. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test\
  \ between simulated and scaled temperature distributions shows that accelerated\
  \ warming over the TP from 1.5\_\xB0C to 2\_\xB0C follows a broadly linear response,\
  \ but the nonlinearity occurs between 2\_\xB0C and 3\_\xB0C. This suggests that\
  \ the rate of warming might make a large difference to the future TP amplification\
  \ at different thresholds."

abstract: "Glucocorticoids reduce phobic fear in anxiety disorders and enhance psychotherapy,\
  \ possibly by reducing the retrieval of fear memories and enhancing the consolidation\
  \ of new corrective memories. Glucocorticoid signaling in the basolateral amygdala\
  \ can influence connected fear and memory-related cortical regions, but this is\
  \ not fully understood. Previous studies investigated specific pathways moderated\
  \ by glucocorticoids, for example, visual-temporal pathways; however, these analyses\
  \ were limited to a-priori selected regions. Here, we performed whole-brain pattern\
  \ analysis to localize phobic stimulus decoding related to the fear-reducing effect\
  \ of glucocorticoids. We reanalyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)\
  \ data from a previously published study with spider-phobic patients and healthy\
  \ controls. The patients received glucocorticoids or a placebo before the exposure\
  \ to spider images. There was moderate evidence that patients with phobia had higher\
  \ decoding of phobic content in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the left\
  \ and right anterior insula compared to controls. Decoding in the ACC and the right\
  \ insula showed strong evidence for correlation with experienced fear. Patients\
  \ with cortisol reported a reduction of fear by 10\u201313%; however, there was\
  \ only weak evidence for changes in neural decoding compared to placebo which was\
  \ found in the precuneus, the opercular cortex, and the left cerebellum."

abstract: The diary food factories in Japan are facing serious challenges of severe
  labor shortage and the increased diversity of demand. Food manufacturing companies
  are forced to improve factories to be more productive and flexible to deal with
  the expanding market scale in the future and also the product diversity. To improve
  the productivity and the flexibility, automation technologies have been implemented
  in manufacturing system with the popularization of Industrial 4.0 and Smart Factory.
  Based on the actual system construction practice of a dairy factory which is as
  a case study, this paper proposes a five-level horizontal model with automation
  technologies, aiming to realize high efficiency, rapid integration and relocation
  of the manufacturing system. This paper introduces the composition, the specifications
  and the functions of the horizontal model, and evaluates the function of each level.
  Finally, through the case study and numerical comparison on cost and labor hours,
  we verify the superiority of the proposed horizontal hierarchical system model for
  food factories.

abstract: Naturalistic driving studies (NDS) are increasingly being used to investigate
  driver on-road behavior. In parallel, smartphones are gaining interest as data acquisition
  systems (DAS) in NDS instead of costly in-vehicle DAS. However, smartphone and in-vehicle
  DAS differ across several attributes and no current document outlines the implications
  of using smartphones as DAS in NDS. In this document, we present a comparative review
  of the advantages and disadvantages of using smartphone and in-vehicle DAS in NDS
  and discuss their implications. In addition, we present a brief account on prospective
  technological developments that might have further implications for using smartphones
  for studying and advancing road safety. Researchers and practitioners can use this
  review as a general guide to decide which DAS (smartphone or in-vehicle) to use
  in their NDS. For example, smartphones would be a cost-effective alternative for
  studying driving style (e.g., braking and speeding), but an inferior alternative
  to in-vehicle DAS for reconstructing crashes or near crashes and for studying short-term
  relationships between events (e.g., smartphone usage and hard braking). Researchers
  and practitioners can also use this review as an aid for the design of NDS with
  smartphones. For example, we show that it would be advisable to use beacons to know
  if participants were driving their vehicle or riding the bus, and that data completeness
  and accuracy would depend on battery charge and using a cradle. Prospective technologies
  might mitigate the shortcomings that we have outlined and might even dim the distinction
  between the different types of DAS.

abstract: "Matching-type estimators using the propensity score are the major workhorse\
  \ in active labour market policy evaluation. This work investigates if machine learning\
  \ algorithms for estimating the propensity score lead to more credible estimation\
  \ of average treatment effects on the treated using a radius matching framework.\
  \ Considering two popular methods, the results are ambiguous: We find that using\
  \ LASSO based logit models to estimate the propensity score delivers more credible\
  \ results than conventional methods in small and medium sized high dimensional datasets.\
  \ However, the usage of Random Forests to estimate the propensity score may lead\
  \ to a deterioration of the performance in situations with a low treatment share.\
  \ The application reveals a positive effect of the training programme on days in\
  \ employment for long-term unemployed. While the choice of the \u201Cfirst stage\u201D\
  \ is highly relevant for settings with low number of observations and few treated,\
  \ machine learning and conventional estimation becomes more similar in larger samples\
  \ and higher treatment shares."

abstract: OrBiTo was a precompetitive collaboration focused on the development of
  the next generation of Oral Biopharmaceutics Tools. The consortium included world
  leading scientists from nine universities, one regulatory agency, one non-profit
  research organisation, three small/medium sized specialist technology companies
  together with thirteen pharmaceutical companies. The goal of the OrBiTo project
  was to deliver a framework for rational application of predictive biopharmaceutics
  tools for oral drug delivery. This goal was achieved through novel prospective investigations
  to define new methodologies or refinement of existing tools. Extensive validation
  has been performed of novel and existing biopharmaceutics tools using historical
  datasets supplied by industry partners as well as laboratory ring studies. A combination
  of high quality in vitro and in vivo characterizations of active drugs and formulations
  have been integrated into physiologically based in silico biopharmaceutics models
  capturing the full complexity of gastrointestinal drug absorption and some of the
  best practices has been highlighted. This approach has given an unparalleled opportunity
  to deliver transformational change in European industrial research and development
  towards model based pharmaceutical product development in accordance with the vision
  of model-informed drug development.

abstract: "As sensory evaluation relies upon humans accurately communicating their\
  \ sensory experience, the diverse and overlapping vocabulary of flavor descriptors\
  \ remains a major challenge. The lexicon generation protocols used in methods like\
  \ Descriptive Analysis are expensive and time-consuming, while the post-facto analyses\
  \ of natural vocabulary in \u201Cquick and dirty\u201D methods like Free Choice\
  \ or Flash Profiling require considerable subjective decision-making on the part\
  \ of the analyst. A potential alternative for producing lexicons and analyzing the\
  \ sensory attributes of products in nonstandardized text can be found in Natural\
  \ Language Processing (NLP). NLP tools allow for the analysis of larger volumes\
  \ of free text with fewer subjective decisions. This paper describes the steps necessary\
  \ to automatically collect, clean, and analyze existing product descriptions from\
  \ the web. As a case study, online reviews of international whiskies from two prominent\
  \ websites (2309 reviews from WhiskyCast and 4289 reviews from WhiskyAdvocate) were\
  \ collected, preprocessed to only retain potentially-descriptive nouns, adjectives,\
  \ and verbs, and then the final term list was grouped into a flavor wheel using\
  \ Correspondence Analysis and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering. The wheel is\
  \ compared to an existing Scotch flavor wheel. The ease of collecting nonstandardized\
  \ descriptions of products and the improved speed of automated methods can facilitate\
  \ collection of descriptive sensory data for products where no lexicon exists. This\
  \ has the potential to speed up and standardize many of the bottlenecks in rapid\
  \ descriptive methods and facilitate the collection and use of very large datasets\
  \ of product descriptions."

abstract: "Background\nOnline crowdsourcing methods have proved useful for studies\
  \ of diverse designs in the behavioral and addiction sciences. The remote and online\
  \ setting of crowdsourcing research may provide easier access to unique participant\
  \ populations and improved comfort for these participants in sharing sensitive health\
  \ or behavioral information. To date, few studies have evaluated the use of qualitative\
  \ research methods on crowdsourcing platforms and even fewer have evaluated the\
  \ quality of data gathered. The purpose of the present analysis was to document\
  \ the feasibility and validity of using crowdsourcing techniques for collecting\
  \ qualitative data among people who use drugs.\nMethods\nParticipants (N\u202F=\u202F\
  60) with a history of non-medical prescription opioid use with transition to heroin\
  \ or fentanyl use were recruited using Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk). A battery\
  \ of qualitative questions was included indexing beliefs and behaviors surrounding\
  \ opioid use, transition pathways to heroin and/or fentanyl use, and drug-related\
  \ contacts with structural institutions (e.g., health care, criminal justice).\n\
  Results\nQualitative data recruitment was feasible as evidenced by the rapid sampling\
  \ of a relatively large number of participants from diverse geographic regions.\
  \ Computerized text analysis indicated high ratings of authenticity for the provided\
  \ narratives. These authenticity percentiles were higher than the average of general\
  \ normative writing samples as well as than those collected in experimental settings.\n\
  Conclusions\nThese findings support the feasibility and quality of qualitative data\
  \ collected in online settings, broadly, and crowdsourced settings, specifically.\
  \ Future work among people who use drugs may leverage crowdsourcing methods and\
  \ the access to hard-to-sample populations to complement existing studies in the\
  \ human laboratory and clinic as well as those using other digital technology methods."

abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and wearable sensors are two essential fields
  to realize the goal of tailoring the best precision medicine treatment for individual
  patients. Integration of these two fields enables better acquisition of patient
  data and improved design of wearable sensors for monitoring the wearers' health,
  fitness and their surroundings. Currently, as the Internet of Things (IoT), big
  data and big health move from concept to implementation, AI-biosensors with appropriate
  technical characteristics are facing new opportunities and challenges. In this paper,
  the most advanced progress made in the key phases for future wearable and implantable
  technology from biosensing, wearable biosensing to AI-biosensing is summarized.
  Without a doubt, material innovation, biorecognition element, signal acquisition
  and transportation, data processing and intelligence decision system are the most
  important parts, which are the main focus of the discussion. The challenges and
  opportunities of AI-biosensors moving forward toward future medicine devices are
  also discussed.

abstract: Many applications of intelligent systems involve understanding a group of
  contrastively different outcome (e.g., all survivors of a deadly cancer, a top performing
  team in a large corporation). The intelligent system needs to identify attributes
  (features) which best describe or explain the group versus its alternatives. In
  data mining, this problem is studied under the framework of contrast set mining
  (CSM). Although CSM is not new, the era of big data has produced new computational
  and statistical challenges. In particular, existing algorithms fail (1) to perform
  efficiently in terms of runtime on large-scale datasets and (2) to accommodate simultaneous
  inference on an overwhelming array of features which are often repetitive and collinear.
  In this paper, we develop a CSM algorithm which addresses both challenges. The computational
  challenge is addressed with a tree structure and two theorems while the statistical
  challenge is addressed with the application of false discovery rate for multiple
  testing. The computational and statistical advantages of the proposed algorithm
  over three state-of-the-art algorithms are demonstrated with comprehensive experiments.
  In addition, we also show the effectiveness of our proposed method in an intelligence-system
  application involving hospital process redesign. The proposed method not only improves
  the performance of machine learning systems, but also generates succinct and insightful
  patterns directly relevant to clinical decision-making.

abstract: "As the problem of urban environment and air pollution continues to intensify,\
  \ the public has developed a very strong perception of the surrounding environment.\
  \ With this growing perception, their emotions and satisfaction about the environment\
  \ may also be greatly affected. This article explores the main factors that affect\
  \ the public\u2019s environmental satisfaction with two main novelties. The first\
  \ is to develop a data acquisition platform. Based on socially aware computing and\
  \ a participatory sensing method, the public\u2019s subjective environmental satisfaction\
  \ is measured by quantifying the collected sensing data. The second is to establish\
  \ a multiple regression model and a correlation model to analyze the relationship\
  \ between public\u2019s environmental satisfaction and atmospheric environmental\
  \ factors, and to compare the influence of each factor. Lanzhou City was taken as\
  \ a case study, and a total of 33505 data points was acquired over a year of experiment.\
  \ The experimental results show: (1) Air pollution in Lanzhou affects public environmental\
  \ satisfaction more strangely than meteorological factors. (2) There is a negative\
  \ correlation between public environmental satisfaction and different air pollutants\
  \ in Lanzhou. (3) PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 are the main influencing factors of the public\u2019\
  s environmental satisfaction in Lanzhou. Overall, our study demonstrates a viable\
  \ method for capturing public environmental satisfaction and identifying probable\
  \ drivers of it, and our results provide important information for policy makers\
  \ to prioritize areas that can more effectively improve public satisfaction."

abstract: "Increasing air pollutants significantly affect the proportion of diffuse\
  \ (Rd) to global (Rs) solar radiation. This study proposed three new hybrid support\
  \ vector machines (SVM) with particle swarm optimization algorithm (SVM-PSO), bat\
  \ algorithm (SVM-BAT) and whale optimization algorithm (SVM-WOA) for predicting\
  \ daily Rd in air-polluted regions. These models were further compared to standalone\
  \ SVM, multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) and extreme gradient boosting\
  \ (XGBoost) models. The results showed that models with suspended particulate matter\
  \ with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5\u202F\u03BCm and 10\u202F\u03BCm (PM2.5\
  \ and PM10) and ozone (O3) produced more accurate daily Rd estimates than those\
  \ without air pollution parameters, with average relative decreases in root mean\
  \ square deviation (RMSD) of 11.1%, 10.0% and 10.4% for sunshine duration-based,\
  \ Rs-based and combined models, respectively. SVM showed better accuracy than XGBoost\
  \ and MARS. However, compared to SVM, SVM-BAT further enhanced the prediction accuracy\
  \ and convergence rate in daily Rd modeling, followed by SVM-WOA and SVM-PSO, with\
  \ relative decreases in RMSD of 2.9%\u20135.6%, 1.9%\u20134.9% and 1.1%\u20133.3%,\
  \ respectively. The results highlighted the significance of incorporating air pollutants\
  \ for more accurate estimation of daily Rd in air-polluted regions. Heuristic algorithms,\
  \ especially BAT, are highly recommended for improving performance of standalone\
  \ machine learning models."

abstract: Embracing the concept of resilience within coastal management marks a step
  change in thinking, building on the inputs of more traditional risk assessments,
  and further accounting for capacities to respond, recover and implement contingency
  measures. Nevertheless, many past resilience assessments have been theoretical and
  have failed to address the requirements of practitioners. Assessment methods can
  also be subjective, relying on opinion-based judgements, and can lack empirical
  validation. Scope exists to address these challenges through drawing on rapidly
  emerging sources of data and smart analytics. This, alongside the careful selection
  of the metrics used in assessment of resilience, can facilitate more robust assessment
  methods. This work sets out to establish a set of core metrics, and data sources
  suitable for inclusion within a data-driven coastal resilience assessment. A case
  study region of East Anglia, UK, is focused on, and data types and sources associated
  with a set of proven assessment metrics were identified. Virtually all risk-specific
  metrics could be satisfied using available or derived data sources. However, a high
  percentage of the resilience-specific metrics would still require human input. This
  indicates that assessment of resilience is inherently more subjective than assessment
  of risk. Yet resilience assessments incorporate both risk and resilience specific
  variables. As such it was possible to link 75% of our selected metrics to empirical
  sources. Through taking a case study approach and discussing a set of requirements
  outlined by a coastal authority, this paper reveals scope for the incorporation
  of rapidly progressing data collection, dissemination, and analytical methods, within
  dynamic coastal resilience assessments. This could facilitate more sustainable evidence-based
  management of coastal regions.

abstract: In this paper, a novel robust Bayesian network is proposed for process modeling
  with low-quality data. Since unreliable data can cause model parameters to deviate
  from the real distributions and make network structures unable to characterize the
  true causalities, data quality feature is utilized to improve the process modeling
  and monitoring performance. With a predetermined trustworthy center, the data quality
  measurement results can be evaluated through an exponential function with Mahalanobis
  distances. The conventional Bayesian network learning algorithms including structure
  learning and parameter learning are modified by the quality feature in a weighting
  form, intending to extract useful information and make a reasonable model. The effectiveness
  of the proposed method is demonstrated through TE benchmark process and a real industrial
  process.

abstract: "Customer engagement (CE) is critical for firms to cultivate and improve\
  \ customer brand experience in the customer journey. However, few studies are available\
  \ on the effects of customer-based driving forces on CE in a defined brand experience\
  \ context. Given the multidimensional nature of CE, the interrelationships among\
  \ CE dimensions and various dimensional effects on the customer\u2013brand relationship,\
  \ represented by brand intimacy, have not been thoroughly explored. To address these\
  \ research gaps, this study explores three customer- and context-based forces that\
  \ drive CE in social media contexts from a consumer\u2019s perspective. CE is operationalized\
  \ as a second-order construct consisting of three dimensions (i.e., consumption,\
  \ contribution, and creation) to reflect its multifaceted nature. An online survey\
  \ was used to collect data. The results suggest that customer-based forces, advice\
  \ seeking, and self-image expression exert positive influences on behavioral CE\
  \ dimensions. The effect of a context-based factor, that is, fashion involvement,\
  \ is salient only when gender difference is integrated. Moreover, the three facets\
  \ of behavioral CE affect brand intimacy to different extents. Brand intimacy is\
  \ the most affected by creation followed by consumption. The research findings contribute\
  \ to the literature on CE and brand intimacy and also offer practical insights on\
  \ marketing communications and segmentation."

abstract: The evaluation, acquisition and use of newly available big data sources
  has become a major strategic and organizational challenge for airline network planners.
  We address this challenge by developing a maturity model for big data readiness
  for airline network planning. The development of the maturity model is grounded
  in literature, expert interviews and case study research involving nine airlines.
  Four airline business models are represented, namely full-service carriers, low-cost
  airlines, scheduled charter airlines and cargo airlines. The maturity model has
  been well received with seven change requests in the model development phase. The
  revised version has been evaluated as exhaustive and useful by airline network planners.
  The self-assessment of airlines revealed low to medium maturity for most domains.
  Organizational factors show the lowest average maturity, IT architecture the highest.
  Full-service carriers seem to be more mature than airlines with different business
  models.

abstract: Discovering new materials with excellent performance is a hot issue in the
  materials genome initiative. Traditional experiments and calculations often waste
  large amounts of time and money and are also limited by various conditions. Therefore,
  it is imperative to develop a new method to accelerate the discovery and design
  of new materials. In recent years, material discovery and design methods using machine
  learning have attracted much attention from material experts and have made some
  progress. This review first outlines available materials database and material data
  analytics tools and then elaborates on the machine learning algorithms used in materials
  science. Next, the field of application of machine learning in materials science
  is summarized, focusing on the aspects of structure determination, performance prediction,
  fingerprint prediction, and new material discovery. Finally, the review points out
  the problems of data and machine learning in materials science and points to future
  research. Using machine learning algorithms, the authors hope to achieve amazing
  results in material discovery and design.

abstract: High-quality data are the foundation to monitor the progress and evaluate
  the effects of road traffic injury prevention measures. Unfortunately, official
  road traffic injury statistics delivered by governments worldwide, are often believed
  somewhat unreliable and invalid. We summarized the reported problems concerning
  the road traffic injury statistics through systematically searching and reviewing
  the literature. The problems include absence of regular data, under-reporting, low
  specificity, distorted cause spectrum of road traffic injury, inconsistency, inaccessibility,
  and delay of data release. We also explored the mechanisms behind the problematic
  data and proposed the solutions to the addressed challenges for road traffic statistics.

abstract: "This paper presents the first palaeodemographic results of a newly assembled\
  \ region-wide radiocarbon record of the Arctic regions of northern Norway. The dataset\
  \ contains a comprehensive collection of radiocarbon dates in the area (N\u202F\
  =\u202F1205) and spans the 10,000-year period of hunter-gatherer settlement history\
  \ from 11500 to 1500\u202Fcal BP. Utilizing local, high-resolution palaeoclimate\
  \ data, the paper performs multi-proxy correlation testing of climate and demographic\
  \ dynamics, looking for hunter-gatherer responses to climate variability. The paper\
  \ compares both long-term climate trends and short-term disruptive climate events\
  \ with the demographic development in the region. The results demonstrate marked\
  \ demographic fluctuations throughout the period, characterized by a general increase,\
  \ punctuated by three significant boom and bust-cycles centred on 6000, 3800 and\
  \ 2200\u202Fcal BP, interpreted as instances of climate forcing of human demographic\
  \ responses. The results strongly suggest the North Cape Current as a primary driver\
  \ in the local environment and supports the patterns of covariance between coastal\
  \ climate proxies and the palaeodemographic model. A mechanism of climate forcing\
  \ mediation through marine trophic webs is proposed as a tentative explanation of\
  \ the observed demographic fluxes, and a comparison with inter-regional results\
  \ demonstrate remarkable similarity in demographic trends across mid-Holocene north\
  \ and west Europe. The results of the north Norwegian radiocarbon record are thus\
  \ consistent with independent, international efforts, corroborating the existing\
  \ pan-European results and help further substantiate super-regional climate variability\
  \ as the primary driver of population dynamics regardless of economic adaptation."

abstract: This paper is a review of the literature on fintech and its interaction
  with banking. Included in fintech are innovations in payment systems (including
  cryptocurrencies), credit markets (including P2P lending), and insurance, with Blockchain-assisted
  smart contracts playing a role. The paper provides a definition of fintech, examines
  some statistics and stylized facts, and then reviews the theoretical and empirical
  literature. The review is organized around four main research questions. The paper
  summarizes our knowledge on these questions and concludes with questions for future
  research.

abstract: "Machine Learning (ML) techniques offer exciting new avenues for leadership\
  \ research. In this paper we discuss how ML techniques can be used to inform predictive\
  \ and causal models of leadership effects and clarify why both types of model are\
  \ important for leadership research. We propose combining ML and experimental designs\
  \ to draw causal inferences by introducing a recently developed technique to isolate\
  \ \u201Cheterogeneous treatment effects.\u201D We provide a step-by-step guide on\
  \ how to design studies that combine field experiments with the application of ML\
  \ to establish causal relationships with maximal predictive power. Drawing on examples\
  \ in the leadership literature, we illustrate how the suggested approach can be\
  \ applied to examine the impact of, for example, leadership behavior on follower\
  \ outcomes. We also discuss how ML can be used to advance leadership research from\
  \ theoretical, methodological and practical perspectives and consider limitations."

abstract: The attacks, faults, and severe communication/system conditions in Mobile
  Crowd Sensing (MCS) make false data detection a critical problem. Observing the
  intrinsic low dimensionality of general monitoring data and the sparsity of false
  data, false data detection can be performed based on the separation of normal data
  and anomalies. Although the existing separation algorithm based on Direct Robust
  Matrix Factorization (DRMF) is proven to be effective, requiring iteratively performing
  Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for low-rank matrix approximation would result
  in a prohibitively high accumulated computation cost when the data matrix is large.
  In this work, we observe the quick false data location feature from our empirical
  study of DRMF, based on which we propose an intelligent Light weight Low Rank and
  False Matrix Separation algorithm (LightLRFMS) that can reuse the previous result
  of the matrix decomposition to deduce the one for the current iteration step. Depending
  on the type of data corruption, random or successive/mass, we design two versions
  of LightLRFMS. From a theoretical perspective, we validate that LightLRFMS only
  requires one round of SVD computation and thus has very low computation cost. We
  have done extensive experiments using a PM 2.5 air condition trace and a road traffic
  trace. Our results demonstrate that LightLRFMS can achieve very good false data
  detection performance with the same highest detection accuracy as DRMF but with
  up to 20 times faster speed thanks to its lower computation cost.

abstract: 'Firms are increasingly turning towards new-age technologies such as artificial
  intelligence (AI), the internet of things (IoT), blockchain, and drones, among others,
  to assist in interacting with their customers. Further, with the prominence of personalization
  and customer engagement as the go-to customer management strategies, it is essential
  for firms to understand how to integrate new-age technologies into their existing
  practices to aid seamlessly in the generation of actionable insights. Towards this
  end, this study proposes an organizing framework to understand how firms can use
  digital analytics, within the changing technology landscape, to generate consumer
  insights. The proposed framework begins by recognizing the forces that are external
  to the firm then lead to the generation of specific capabilities by the firm. Further,
  the firms capabilities can lead to the generation of insights for decision-making
  that can be data-driven and/or analytics-driven. Finally, the proposed framework
  identifies the creation of value-based outcomes for firms and customers resulting
  from the insights generated. Additionally, we identify moderators that influence:
  (a) the impact of external forces on the development of firm capabilities, and (b)
  the creation of insights and subsequent firm outcomes. This study also identifies
  questions for future research that combines the inclusion of new-age technologies,
  generation of strategic insights, and the achievement of established firm outcomes.'

abstract: "The SHEILA framework provides a policy and strategy framework informing\
  \ the strategic implementation and use of learning analytics. However, as evidenced\
  \ in several \u2018ground-up\u2019 implementations of tools, the institutional preparedness\

  \ we depart from familiar approaches and evaluate one such example of a tool's development\
  \ (SRES \u2013 Student Relationship Engagement System). SRES' adoption and scaling\
  \ across two institutions are evaluated using an auto-ethnographic approach scaffolded\
  \ through the dimensions of the SHEILA framework, focusing on the individual perspectives\
  \ of the institutional champions who have been central to this journey. This practical\
  \ approach and the emerging insights may enable other institutions to identify areas\
  \ of potential improvement and inform senior academic managers about the strategic\
  \ requirements to scale the approach, accounting for aspects not considered in the\
  \ initial \u2018organic growth\u2019 of the implementation."

abstract: 'Summary

  The CRISPR-Cas system offers a programmable platform for eukaryotic genome and epigenome
  editing. The ability to perform targeted genetic and epigenetic perturbations enables
  researchers to perform a variety of tasks, ranging from investigating questions
  in basic biology to potentially developing novel therapeutics for the treatment
  of disease. While CRISPR systems have been engineered to target DNA and RNA with
  increased precision, efficiency, and flexibility, assays to identify off-target
  editing are becoming more comprehensive and sensitive. Furthermore, techniques to
  perform high-throughput genome and epigenome editing can be paired with a variety
  of readouts and are uncovering important cellular functions and mechanisms. These
  technological advances drive and are driven by accompanying computational approaches.
  Here, we briefly present available CRISPR technologies and review key computational
  advances and considerations for various CRISPR applications. In particular, we focus
  on the analysis of on- and off-target editing and CRISPR pooled screen data.'

abstract: The present study evaluates the performance of PNN models for porosity prediction
  using seismic attributes. Four seismic datasets and more than 20 wells from different
  sedimentary basins located in Libya, Iraq, Egypt and USA are employed to characterize
  the effective attributes for porosity prediction. Verification and testing error
  analysis is adopted for evaluating the prediction performance. Results indicated
  that the porosity prediction models are primarily dependent to the propagation related
  attributes with frequency attributes as the most effective parameters in porosity
  prediction. In addition, the data quality and processing history strongly control
  the prediction model performance with relatively limited effects to dataset dimensionality
  (2D versus 3D) and the number of wells utilized in model construction. Such results
  are important to better understand and evaluate the performance of PNN porosity
  prediction models using various seismic attributes.

abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) is a fundamental concept of a new technology that
  will be promising and significant in various fields. IoT is a vision that allows
  things or objects equipped with sensors, actuators, and processors to talk and communicate
  with each other over the internet to achieve a meaningful goal. Unfortunately, one
  of the major challenges that affect IoT is data quality and uncertainty, as data
  volume increases noise, inconsistency and redundancy increases within data and causes
  paramount issues for IoT technologies. And since IoT is considered to be a massive
  quantity of heterogeneous networked embedded devices that generate big data, then
  it is very complex to compute and analyze such massive data. So this paper introduces
  a new model named NRDD-DBSCAN based on DBSCAN algorithm and using resilient distributed
  datasets (RDDs) to detect outliers that affect the data quality of IoT technologies.
  NRDD-DBSCAN has been applied on three different datasets of N-dimensions (2-D, 3-D,
  and 25-D) and the results were promising. Finally, comparisons have been made between
  NRDD-DBSCAN and previous models such as RDD-DBSCAN model and DBSCAN algorithm, and
  these comparisons proved that NRDD-DBSCAN solved the low dimensionality issue of
  RDD-DBSCAN model and also solved the fact that DBSCAN algorithm cannot handle IoT
  data. So the conclusion is that NRDD-DBSCAN proposed model can detect the outliers
  that exist in the datasets of N-dimensions by using resilient distributed datasets
  (RDDs), and NRDD-DBSCAN can enhance the quality of data exists in IoT applications
  and technologies.

abstract: This review highlights recent advances in atopic dermatitis (AD) and food
  allergy (FA), particularly on molecular mechanisms and disease endotypes, recent
  developments in global strategies for the management of patients, pipeline for future
  treatments, primary and secondary prevention and psychosocial aspects. During the
  recent years, there has been major advances in personalized/precision medicine linked
  to better understanding of disease pathophysiology and precision treatment options
  of AD. A greater understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of AD through
  substantial progress in epidemiology, genetics, skin immunology and psychological
  aspects resulted in advancements in the precision management of AD. However, the
  implementation of precision medicine in the management of AD still requires the
  validation of reliable biomarkers, which will provide more tailored management,
  starting from prevention strategies towards targeted therapies for more severe diseases.
  Cutaneous exposure to food via defective barriers is an important route of sensitization
  to food allergens. Studies on the role of the skin barrier genes demonstrated their
  association with the development of IgE-mediated FA, and suggest novel prevention
  and treatment strategies for type 2 diseases in general because of their link to
  barrier defects not only in AD and FA, but also in asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis,
  allergic rhinitis and inflammatory bowel disease. The development of more accurate
  diagnostic tools, biomarkers for early prediction, and innovative solutions require
  a better understanding of molecular mechanisms and the pathophysiology of FA. Based
  on these developments, this review provides an overview of novel developments and
  advances in AD and FA, which are reported particularly during the last two years.

abstract: Hyperspectral imaging technology has evolved for over thirty years and is
  widely used for geologic mapping, environmental monitoring, vegetation analysis,
  atmospheric characterization, biological and chemical detection, etc. With advances
  in technology, hyperspectral imagery not only determines the presence of materials
  and objects, but more importantly, also quantifies the variability and abundance
  of the identified materials or objects. Airborne hyperspectral imagers still perform
  a vital role in remote sensing fields due to advantages of spatial resolution, performance
  capabilities in a cloudy atmosphere, and onboard maintenance as compared to similar
  imagers aboard spaceborne platforms. To date, hundreds of airborne hyperspectral
  systems have been designed, built, and operated. Here, a review of key technologies
  for airborne hyperspectral imaging technology during past three decades is presented.
  First discussed will be high throughput imaging modes, high quality spectroscopic
  subsystems, and high sensitivity detector technology used on current airborne hyperspectral
  imagers. Particularly, the importance of data-processing such as calibration, geometric
  rectification, and atmospheric correction are discussed. Next, several new and novel
  applications are presented on the basis of state-of-the-art airborne hyperspectral
  technology. Finally, an outlook of challenges and future technology directions is
  presented along with general advice for designing and realizing novel high-performance
  airborne hyperspectral systems in this rapidly evolving field. By illustrating the
  status and prospects of typical airborne hyperspectral imagers, this overview provides
  a comparison of the technologies employed in previous hyperspectral imaging systems,
  current imaging technology research programs and prospects for innovative technology
  in future airborne hyperspectral imaging platforms.

abstract: "As a much finer particle, particulate matter less than 1\_\u03BCm (PM1)\
  \ plays an important role on the haze formation and human health. However, the capability\
  \ of mapping PM1 concentration is severely impaired by coarse temporal resolution\
  \ and low estimation accuracy, largely due to the neglect of spatial or temporal\
  \ autocorrelation of PM1. In order to improve the estimation of high-resolution\
  \ PM1, here we developed a novel spatiotemporal model named extreme gradient boosting\
  \ (XGBoost)-geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) using Himawari-8\
  \ aerosol optical depth (AOD), meteorological factors, and geographical covariates.\
  \ The estimation of PM1 over Zhejiang province showed that XGBoost-GTWR method was\
  \ characterized by greater predictive ability (10-fold cross-validation R2\_=\_\
  0.83, root mean squared error (RMSE)\_=\_10.72\_\u03BCg/m3) compared with other\
  \ 11 models. Additionally, the extrapolation test was performed to validate the\
  \ robustness of the hybrid model and the result demonstrated that XGBoost-GTWR can\
  \ accurately predict the out-of-band PM1 concentration (R2\_=\_0.75 (0.60), RMSE\_\
  =\_12.71 (12.58) \u03BCg/m3). The PM1 concentration displayed pronounced spatial\
  \ heterogeneity, with the highest value in Quzhou (34.72\_\xB1\_1.77\_\u03BCg/m3)\
  \ and the lowest in Zhoushan (26.39\_\xB1\_1.56\_\u03BCg/m3), respectively. In terms\
  \ of the seasonality, the highest PM1 concentration was observed in winter (39.06\_\
  \xB1\_3.08\_\u03BCg/m3), followed by those in spring (32.54\_\xB1\_3.09\_\u03BC\
  g/m3) and autumn (30.97\_\xB1\_4.50\_\u03BCg/m3), and the lowest one in summer (25.57\_\
  \xB1\_5.22\_\u03BCg/m3). The high aerosol emission and adverse meteorological conditions\
  \ (e.g., low boundary layer height and lack of precipitation) were key factors accounting\
  \ for the peak PM1 concentration observed in winter. Also, the PM1 concentration\
  \ exhibited significant diurnal variation, peaking at 1500 local solar time (LST)\
  \ but reaching the lowest value at 1000 LST. This method enhances our capability\
  \ of estimating hourly PM1 from space, and lays a solid data foundation for improving\
  \ the assessment of the fine particle-related health effect."

abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy acts as the best tool that
  can be used in tissue engineering scaffolds to investigate unknown metabolites.
  Moreover, metabolomics is a systems approach for examining in vivo and in vitro
  metabolic profiles, which promises to provide data on cancer metabolic alterations.
  However, metabolomic profiling allows for the activity of small molecules and metabolic
  alterations to be measured. Furthermore, metabolic profiling also provides high-spectral
  resolution, which can then be linked to potential metabolic relationships. An altered
  metabolism is a hallmark of cancer that can control many malignant properties to
  drive tumorigenesis. Metabolite targeting and metabolic engineering contribute to
  carcinogenesis by proliferation, and metabolic differentiation. The resulting the
  metabolic differences are examined with traditional chemometric methods such as
  principal component analysis (PCA), and partial least squares-discriminate analysis
  (PLS-DA). In this review, we examine NMR-based activity metabolomic platforms that
  can be used to analyze various fluxomics and for multivariant statistical analysis
  in cancer. We also aim to provide the reader with a basic understanding of NMR spectroscopy,
  cancer metabolomics, target profiling, chemometrics, and multifunctional tools for
  metabolomics discrimination, with a focus on metabolic phenotypic diversity for
  cancer therapeutics.

abstract: Advancing a new drug to market requires substantial investments in time
  as well as financial resources. Crucial bioactivities for drug candidates, including
  their efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and adverse effects, need to be investigated
  during drug development. With advancements in chemical synthesis and biological
  screening technologies over the past decade, a large amount of biological data points
  for millions of small molecules have been generated and are stored in various databases.
  These accumulated data, combined with new machine learning (ML) approaches, such
  as deep learning, have shown great potential to provide insights into relevant chemical
  structures to predict in vitro, in vivo, and clinical outcomes, thereby advancing
  drug discovery and development in the big data era.

abstract: Persistent lack of non-motorized traffic counts can affect the evidence-based
  decisions of transportation planning and safety-concerned agencies in making reliable
  investments in bikeway and other non-motorized facilities. Researchers have used
  various approaches to estimate bicycles counts, such as scaling, direct-demand modeling,
  time series, and others. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have tried
  to use crowdsourced data for estimating the bicycle counts. Crowdsourced data only
  represents a small percentage of cyclists. This percentage, on the other hand, can
  change based on the location, facility type, meteorological, and other factors.
  Moreover, the autocorrelation observed in bicycle counts may be different from the
  autocorrelation structure observed among crowdsourced platform users, such as Strava.
  Strava users are more consistent; hence, the time series count data may be stationary,
  while bicycle demand may vary based on seasonal factors. In addition to seasonal
  variation, several time-invariant contributing factors (e.g., facility type, roadway
  characteristics, household income) affect bicycle demand, which needs to be accounted
  for when developing direct demand models. In this paper, we use a mixed-effects
  model with autocorrelated errors to predict daily bicycle counts from crowdsourced
  data across the state of Texas. Additionally, we supplement crowdsourced data with
  other spatial and temporal factors such as roadway facility, household income, population
  demographics, population density and weather conditions to predict bicycle counts.
  The results show that using a robust methodology, we can predict bicycle demand
  with a 29% margin of error, which is significantly lower than merely scaling the
  crowdsourced data (41%).

abstract: "This study examines the dynamic responses of monthly Australian inbound\
  \ tourist arrivals to higher frequency daily movements in the exchange rate. Many\
  \ existing models of inbound tourism utilize currency values averaged over months\
  \ or quarters to match available visitor data, thus discarding valuable dynamic\
  \ information from higher frequency variations in the exchange rate. We employ a\
  \ Mixed Data Sampling (MIDAS) approach, modelling monthly Australian inbound tourism\
  \ from 1998 to 2018, while utilising daily observations of the domestic currency\
  \ as an explanatory variable. The findings suggest that models that take averages\
  \ of exchange rate data to match frequencies may substantially underestimate how\
  \ sensitive tourists are in responding to short-term fluctuations in the exchange\
  \ rate. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of such responses typically are observed\
  \ within 15\u201320 days prior to travel. After considering time horizons of up\
  \ to 90 days, our findings indicate that travelers are predominantly concerned with\
  \ exchange rate variations again only within three weeks prior to their departures.\
  \ The results suggest that the Mixed Data Sampling (MIDAS) methodology can be a\
  \ useful supplement to traditional approaches to modelling tourism demand. MIDAS\
  \ models can provide rich insights into the duration and patterns of the dynamic\
  \ interplay between the variables of interest."

abstract: "We use gravity information obtained from the XGM2016 global gravitational\
  \ model together with topographic, bathymetric and seismic data to interpret the\
  \ crustal structure beneath Cameroon and adjoined geological regions. For this purpose,\
  \ we apply the regularized non-linear gravity inversion for a gravimetric determination\
  \ of the Moho depth utilizing existing results of seismic data analysis as constraints.\
  \ The estimated Moho model reflects regional tectonic configuration and geological\
  \ structure of this region, mainly consisting of two major geological units, i.e.\
  \ the Cameroon Volcanic Line and the Congo Craton. A validation of gravimetric result\
  \ at sites of the Cameroon Broadband Seismic Experiment (CBSE) reveals overall similarities\
  \ between gravimetric and seismic estimates. A comparison of our result is also\
  \ conducted with previously published results. The cross-comparison of these results\
  \ reveals a good agreement between them, particularly beneath the Cameroon Volcanic\
  \ Line, the Adamawa Plateau and the Garoua Rift. Nevertheless, some relatively large\
  \ inconsistencies roughly reaching \xB110\u202Fkm in estimated values of the Moho\
  \ depth are identified in geological regions of the Congo Craton and the Yaound\xE9\
  \ domain. The spatial correlation analysis between the Moho geometry and the topography\
  \ indicates an isostatic state of particular geological units, suggesting their\
  \ compensation stage. Our result closely agrees with the assumption that most of\
  \ isostatically over compensated geological structures were formed during a compressional\
  \ tectonic regime, except for the Garoua Rift that was likely formed during an extensional\
  \ regime. We also computed the Bouguer gravity data at different constant elevations\
  \ above sea level in order to supress a gravitational signature of shallower sources,\
  \ while enhancing a gravitational signature from deeper crustal and lithospheric\
  \ structures, focusing primarily on cores of major cratonic formations. The Bouguer\
  \ gravity maps indicate that the Yaound\xE9 domain likely represents the crustal\
  \ manifestation of the suture zone between the Congo Craton and the Adamawa-Yad\xE9\
  \ domain, acting as a micro-continent."

abstract: "Summary\nExtreme weather events can cause heat stress that decreases crop\
  \ production. Recent studies have demonstrated that protein degradation and rRNA\
  \ homeostasis as well as transcription factors are involved in the thermoresponse\
  \ in plants. However, how RNA modifications contribute to temperature stress response\
  \ in plant remains largely unknown. Herein, we identified OsNSUN2 as an RNA 5-methylcytosine\
  \ (m5C) methyltransferase in rice. osnsun2 mutant displayed severe temperature-\
  \ and light-dependent lesion-mimic phenotypes and heat-stress hypersensitivity.\
  \ Heat stress enhanced the OsNSUN2-dependent m5C modification of mRNAs involved\
  \ in photosynthesis and detoxification systems, such as \u03B2-OsLCY, OsHO2, OsPAL1,\
  \ and OsGLYI4, which increased protein synthesis. Furthermore, the photosystem of\
  \ osnsun2 mutant was vulnerable to high ambient temperature and failed to undergo\
  \ repair under tolerable heat stress. Thus, OsNSUN2 mutation reduced photosynthesis\
  \ efficiency and accumulated excessive reactive oxygen species upon heat treatment.\
  \ Our findings demonstrate an important mechanism of mRNA m5C-dependent heat acclimation\
  \ in rice."

abstract: The impact of the Internet of Things (IoT) on the advancement of the healthcare
  industry is immense. The ushering of the Medicine 4.0 has resulted in an increased
  effort to develop platforms, both at the hardware level as well as the underlying
  software level. This vision has led to the development of Healthcare IoT (H-IoT)
  systems. The basic enabling technologies include the communication systems between
  the sensing nodes and the processors; and the processing algorithms for generating
  an output from the data collected by the sensors. However, at present, these enabling
  technologies are also supported by several new technologies. The use of Artificial
  Intelligence (AI) has transformed the H-IoT systems at almost every level. The fog/edge
  paradigm is bringing the computing power close to the deployed network and hence
  mitigating many challenges in the process. While the big data allows handling an
  enormous amount of data. Additionally, the Software Defined Networks (SDNs) bring
  flexibility to the system while the blockchains are finding the most novel use cases
  in H-IoT systems. The Internet of Nano Things (IoNT) and Tactile Internet (TI) are
  driving the innovation in the H-IoT applications. This paper delves into the ways
  these technologies are transforming the H-IoT systems and also identifies the future
  course for improving the Quality of Service (QoS) using these new technologies.

abstract: 'Urban big data fusion creates huge values for urban computing in solving
  urban problems. In recent years, various models and algorithms based on deep learning
  have been proposed to unlock the power of knowledge from urban big data. To clarify
  the methodologies of urban big data fusion based on deep learning (DL), this paper
  classifies them into three categories: DL-output-based fusion, DL-input-based fusion
  and DL-double-stage-based fusion. These methods use deep learning to learn feature
  representation from multi-source big data. Then each category of fusion methods
  is introduced and some examples are shown. The difficulties and ideas of dealing
  with urban big data will also be discussed.'

abstract: "Over the past decade, the global proliferation of cyanobacterial harmful\
  \ algal blooms (CyanoHABs) have presented a major risk to the public and wildlife,\
  \ and ecosystem and economic services provided by inland water resources. As a consequence,\
  \ water resources, environmental, and healthcare agencies are in need of early information\
  \ about the development of these blooms to mitigate or minimize their impact. Results\
  \ from various components of a novel multi-cloud cyber-infrastructure referred to\
  \ as \u201CCyanoTRACKER\u201D for initial detection and continuous monitoring of\
  \ spatio-temporal growth of CyanoHABs is highlighted in this study. The novelty\
  \ of the CyanoTRACKER framework is the collection and integration of combined community\
  \ reports (social cloud), remote sensing data (sensor cloud) and digital image analytics\
  \ (computation cloud) to detect and differentiate between regular algal blooms and\
  \ CyanoHABs. Individual components of CyanoTRACKER include a reporting website,\
  \ mobile application (App), remotely deployable solar powered automated hyperspectral\
  \ sensor (CyanoSense), and a cloud-based satellite data processing and integration\
  \ tool. All components of CyanoTRACKER provided important data related to CyanoHABs\
  \ assessments for regional and global water bodies. Reports and data received via\
  \ social cloud including the mobile App, Twitter, Facebook, and CyanoTRACKER website,\
  \ helped in identifying the geographic locations of CyanoHABs affected water bodies.\
  \ A significant increase (124.92%) in tweet numbers related to CyanoHABs was observed\
  \ between 2011 (total relevant tweets\_=\_2925) and 2015 (total relevant tweets\_\
  =\_6579) that reflected an increasing trend of the harmful phenomena across the\
  \ globe as well as an increased awareness about CyanoHABs among Twitter users. The\
  \ CyanoHABs affected water bodies extracted via the social cloud were categorized,\
  \ and smaller water bodies were selected for the deployment of CyanoSense, and satellite\
  \ data analysis was performed for larger water bodies. CyanoSense was able to differentiate\
  \ between ordinary algae and CyanoHABs through the use of their characteristic absorption\
  \ feature at 620\_nm. The results and products from this infrastructure can be rapidly\
  \ disseminated via the CyanoTRACKER website, social media, and direct communication\
  \ with appropriate management agencies for issuing warnings and alerting lake managers,\
  \ stakeholders and ordinary citizens to the dangers posed by these environmentally\
  \ harmful phenomena."

abstract: How to explore and exploit the full potential of artificial intelligence
  (AI) technologies in future wireless communications such as beyond 5G (B5G) and
  6G is an extremely hot inter-disciplinary research topic around the world. On the
  one hand, AI empowers intelligent resource management for wireless communications
  through powerful learning and automatic adaptation capabilities. On the other hand,
  embracing AI in wireless communication resource management calls for new network
  architecture and system models as well as standardized interfaces/protocols/data
  formats to facilitate the large-scale deployment of AI in future B5G/6G networks.
  This paper reviews the state-of-art AI-empowered resource management from the framework
  perspective down to the methodology perspective, not only considering the radio
  resource (e.g., spectrum) management but also other types of resources such as computing
  and caching. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities for AI-based resource
  management to widely deploy AI in future wireless communication networks.

abstract: "Accurately mapping plate boundary types and locations through time is essential\
  \ for understanding the evolution of the plate-mantle system and the exchange of\
  \ material between the solid Earth and surface environments. However, the complexity\
  \ of the Earth system and the cryptic nature of the geological record make it difficult\
  \ to discriminate tectonic environments through deep time. Here we present a new\
  \ method for identifying tectonic paleo-environments on Earth through a data mining\
  \ approach using global geochemical data. We first fingerprint a variety of present-day\
  \ tectonic environments utilising up to 136 geochemical data attributes in any available\
  \ combination. A total of 38301 geochemical analyses from basalts aged from 5\u2013\
  0\_Ma together with a well-established plate reconstruction model are used to construct\
  \ a suite of discriminatory models for the first order tectonic environments of\
  \ subduction and mid-ocean ridge as distinct from intraplate hotspot oceanic environments,\
  \ identifying 41, 35, and 39 key discriminatory geochemical attributes, respectively.\
  \ After training and validation, our model is applied to a global geochemical database\
  \ of 1547 basalt samples of unknown tectonic origin aged between 1000\u2013410\_\
  Ma, a relatively ill-constrained period of Earth's evolution following the breakup\
  \ of the Rodinia supercontinent, producing 56 unique global tectonic environment\
  \ predictions throughout the Neoproterozoic and Early Paleozoic. Predictions are\
  \ used to discriminate between three alternative published Rodinia configuration\
  \ models, identifying the model demonstrating the closest spatio-temporal consistency\
  \ with the basalt record, and emphasizing the importance of integrating geochemical\
  \ data into plate reconstructions. Our approach offers an extensible framework for\
  \ constructing full-plate, deep-time reconstructions capable of assimilating a broad\
  \ range of geochemical and geological observations, enabling next generation Earth\
  \ system models."

abstract: 'To enhance the credibility of human reliability analysis, various kinds
  of data have been recently collected and analyzed. Although it is obvious that the
  quality of data is critical, the practices or considerations for securing data quality
  have not been sufficiently discussed. In this work, based on the experience of the
  recent human reliability data extraction projects, which produced more than fifty
  thousand data-points, we derive a number of issues to be considered for generating
  meaningful data. As a result, thirteen considerations are presented here as pertaining
  to the four different data extraction activities: preparation, collection, analysis,
  and application. Although the lessons were acquired from a single kind of data collection
  framework, it is believed that these results will guide researchers to consider
  important issues in the process of extracting data.'

  In Germany there are about 4 million people living with a rare disease. Studies\
  \ have shown that big data applications can improve diagnosis of and research on\
  \ rare diseases more effectively. However, no concrete comprehensive concept for\
  \ the use of big data in the care of people with rare diseases has so far been established\
  \ in Germany. As part of the project \u201CBIDA-SE\u201D, which is funded by the\
  \ German Ministry of Health, a first scenario has been designed to show how big\
  \ data applications can be usefully incorporated into the care of people with rare\
  \ diseases.\nMethods\nThe aim of the present study was to evaluate this scenario\
  \ with regard to acceptance, (clinical) benefits, economic aspects, and limitations\
  \ and barriers to its implementation. To evaluate the scenario, an online survey\
  \ was conducted in Germany in October/November 2019 amongst a total of N\_=\_9 physicians,\
  \ N\_=\_69 patients with rare diseases/patient representatives, N\_=\_14 IT experts\
  \ and N\_=\_21 health care researchers. The online questionnaire consisted of both\
  \ standardized, validated questions taken from already tested survey instruments\
  \ and additional questions which were constructed on the basis of a preceding literature\
  \ analysis. The evaluation of the survey was primarily descriptive, with a calculation\
  \ of frequencies, mean values and standard deviations.\nResults\nThe results of\
  \ the evaluation show that the scenario has been accepted by a majority of all groups\
  \ surveyed (physicians, patients/patient representatives, IT experts and health\
  \ care researchers). From the point of view of physicians, patients/patient representatives\
  \ and health care researchers, the scenario has the potential to accelerate the\
  \ diagnosis and initiation of therapy and to improve cross-sectoral treatment. From\
  \ the physician\u2019s and health care researcher\u2019s perspective, investments\
  \ in the application presented in the scenario would be profitable. Financing the\
  \ scenario would, however, require adjusting the reimbursement situation. The limitations\
  \ and barriers identified by all groups for a medium-term implementation of the\
  \ scenario can be grouped into seven thematic areas where action is needed: (1)\

  \ scenario and to channel access to the Centres for Rare Diseases in the future.\n\
  Conclusion\nMany activities have been initiated at a national level to improve the\
  \ health care situation of people with rare diseases. The scenario developed in\
  \ the \u201CBIDA-SE\u201D project complements these research activities and illustrates\
  \ how big data applications can be usefully implemented into practice to improve\
  \ the diagnosis and therapy of people with rare diseases in a sustainable way."

abstract: "Background and aims\nWith no approved vaccines for treating COVID-19 as\
  \ of August 2020, many health systems and governments rely on contact tracing as\
  \ one of the prevention and containment methods. However, there have been instances\
  \ when the infected person forgets his/her contact-persons and does not have their\
  \ contact details. Therefore, this study aimed at analyzing possible opportunities\
  \ and challenges of integrating emerging technologies into COVID-19 contact tracing.\n\
  Methods\nThe study applied literature search from Google Scholar, Science Direct,\
  \ PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE and WHO COVID-19 reports and guidelines analyzed.\n\
  Results\nWhile the integration of technology-based contact tracing applications\
  \ to combat COVID-19 and break transmission chains promise to yield better results,\
  \ these technologies face challenges such as technical limitations, dealing with\
  \ asymptomatic individuals, lack of supporting ICT infrastructure and electronic\
  \ health policy, socio-economic inequalities, deactivation of mobile devices\u2019\
  \ WIFI, GPS services, interoperability and standardization issues, security risks,\
  \ privacy issues, political and structural responses, ethical and legal risks, consent\
  \ and voluntariness, abuse of contact tracing apps, and discrimination.\nConclusion\n\
  Integrating emerging technologies into COVID-19 contact tracing is seen as a viable\
  \ option that policymakers, health practitioners and IT technocrats need to seriously\
  \ consider in mitigating the spread of coronavirus. Further research is also required\
  \ on how best to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the utilisation of emerging\
  \ technologies in contact tracing while observing the security and privacy of people\
  \ in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic."

abstract: Todays' Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications majorly depend
  on either limited neighbouring traffic data or crowd sourced stale traffic data.
  Enabling big traffic data analytics in ITS environments is a step closer towards
  utilizing significant traffic patterns and trends for making more precise and intelligent
  decisions particularly in connected autonomous vehicular environments. Towards this
  end, this paper presents a Traffic Aware Data Offloading (TRADING) approach for
  big traffic data centric ITS applications in connected autonomous vehicular environments.
  Specifically, TRADING balances offloading data traffic among gateways focusing on
  vehicular traffic and network status in the vicinity of gateways. In addition, TRADING
  mitigates the effect of gateway advertisement overhead to liberate the transmission
  channels for traffic big data transmission. The performance of TRADING is comparatively
  evaluated in a realistic simulation environment by considering gateway access overhead,
  load distribution among gateways, data offloading delay, and data offloading success
  ratio. The comparative performance evaluation results show some significant developments
  towards enabling big traffic data centric ITS.

abstract: DNA methylation (5mC) and hydroxymethylation (5hmC) are chemical modifications
  of cytosine bases which play a crucial role in epigenetic gene regulation. However,
  cost, data complexity and unavailability of comprehensive analytical tools is one
  of the major challenges in exploring these epigenetic marks. Hydroxymethylation-and
  Methylation-Sensitive Tag sequencing (HMST-seq) is one of the most cost-effective
  techniques that enables simultaneous detection of 5mC and 5hmC at single base pair
  resolution. We present HMST-Seq-Analyzer as a comprehensive and robust method for
  performing simultaneous differential methylation analysis on 5mC and 5hmC data sets.
  HMST-Seq-Analyzer can detect Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs), annotate
  them, give a visual overview of methylation status and also perform preliminary
  quality check on the data. In addition to HMST-Seq, our tool can be used on whole-genome
  bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS)
  data sets as well. The tool is written in Python with capacity to process data in
  parallel and is available at (https://hmst-seq.github.io/hmst/).

abstract: Soil erosion is one of the most severe global environmental problems, and
  soil erosion surveys are the scientific basis for planning soil conservation and
  ecological development. To improve soil erosion sampling survey methods and accurately
  and rapidly estimate the actual rates of soil erosion, a Pan-Third Pole region was
  taken as an example to study a methodology of soil erosion sampling survey based
  on high-spatial-resolution remote sensing images. The sampling units were designed
  using a stratified variable probability systematic sampling method. The spatiotemporal
  characteristics of soil erosion and conservation were taken into account, and finer-resolution
  freely available and accessible images in Google Earth were used. Through the visual
  interpretation of the free high-resolution remote sensing images, detailed information
  on land use and soil conservation measures was obtained. Then, combined with the
  regional soil erosion factor data products, such as rainfall-runoff erosivity factor
  (R), soil erodibility factor (K), and slope length and steepness factor (LS), the
  soil loss rates of some sampling units were calculated. The results show that, based
  on these high-resolution remote sensing images, the land use and soil conservation
  measures of the sampling units can be quickly and accurately extracted. The interpretation
  accuracy in 4 typical cross sections was more than 80%, and sampling accuracy, described
  by histogram similarity in 11 large sampling sites, show that the landuse of sampling
  uints can represent the structural characteristics of regional land use. Based on
  the interpretation of data from the sample survey and the regional soil erosion
  factor data products, the calculation of the soil erosion rate can be completed
  quickly. The calculation results can reflect the actual conditions of soil erosion
  better than the potential soil erosion rates calculated by using the coarse-resolution
  remote sensing method.

abstract: Road accidents are one of the most relevant causes of injuries and death
  worldwide, and therefore, they constitute a significant field of research on the
  use of advanced algorithms and techniques to analyze and predict traffic accidents
  and determine the most relevant elements that contribute to road accidents. The
  research of road accident prediction aims to respond to the challenge of offer tools
  to generate a more secure mobility environment, and ultimately, save lives. This
  paper aims to provide an overview of the state of the art in the prediction of road
  accidents through machine learning algorithms and advanced techniques for analyzing
  information, such as convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory networks,
  among other deep learning architectures. Furthermore, in this article, a compendium
  and study of the most used data sources for the road accident forecast is made.
  And a classification is proposed according to its origin and characteristics, such
  as open data, measurement technologies, onboard equipment and social media data.
  For the analysis of the information, the different algorithms employed to make predictions
  about road accidents are listed and compared, as well as their applicability depending
  on the types of data being analyzed, along with the results obtained and their ease
  of interpretation and analysis. The best results reported by the authors are obtained
  when two or more analytic techniques are combined, in such a way that analysis of
  the obtained results is strengthened. Among the future challenges in road traffic
  forecasting lies the enhancement of the scope of the proposed models and predictions
  by the incorporation of heterogeneous data sources, that include geo spatial data,
  information from traffic volume, traffic statistics, video, sound, text and sentiment
  from social media, that many authors concur that can improve the precision and accuracy
  of the analysis and predictions.

abstract: In order to improve the data quality, the big data cleaning method of distribution
  network was studied in this paper. First, the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm
  based on DBSCAN clustering was used to detect outliers. However, due to the difficulty
  in determining the LOF threshold, a method of dynamically calculating the threshold
  based on the transformer districts and time was proposed. Besides, the LOF algorithm
  combines the statistical distribution method to reduce the "misjudgment rate". Aiming
  at the diversity and complexity of data missing forms in power big data, this paper
  improved the Random Forest imputation algorithm, which can be applied to various
  forms of missing data, especially the blocked missing data and even some horizontal
  or vertical data completely missing. The data in this paper were from real data
  of 44 transformer districts of a certain 10kV line in distribution network. Experimental
  results showed that outlier detection was accurate and suitable for any shape and
  multidimensional power big data. The improved Random Forest imputation algorithm
  was suitable for all missing forms, with higher imputation accuracy and better model
  stability. By comparing the network loss prediction between the data using this
  data cleaning method and the data removing outliers and missing values, it was found
  that the accuracy of network loss prediction had been improved by nearly 4 percentage
  points using the data cleaning method mentioned in this paper. Additionally, as
  the proportion of bad data increased, the difference between the prediction accuracy
  of cleaned data and that of uncleaned data was greater.

abstract: We are witnessing a rapid growth of electrified vehicles due to the ever-increasing
  concerns on urban air quality and energy security. Compared to other types of electric
  vehicles, electric buses have not yet been prevailingly adopted worldwide due to
  their high owning and operating costs, long charging time, and the uneven spatial
  distribution of charging facilities. Moreover, the highly dynamic environment factors
  such as unpredictable traffic congestion, different passenger demands, and even
  the changing weather can significantly affect electric bus charging efficiency and
  potentially hinder the further promotion of large-scale electric bus fleets. To
  address these issues, in this article, we first analyze a real-world dataset including
  massive data from 16,359 electric buses, 1,400 bus lines, and 5,562 bus stops. Then,
  we investigate the electric bus network to understand its operating and charging
  patterns, and further verify the necessity and feasibility of a real-time charging
  scheduling. With such understanding, we design busCharging, a pricing-aware real-time
  charging scheduling system based on Markov Decision Process to reduce the overall
  charging and operating costs for city-scale electric bus fleets, taking the time-variant
  electricity pricing into account. To show the effectiveness of busCharging, we implement
  it with the real-world data from Shenzhen, which includes GPS data of electric buses,
  the metadata of all bus lines and bus stops, combined with data of 376 charging
  stations for electric buses. The evaluation results show that busCharging dramatically
  reduces the charging cost by 23.7% and 12.8% of electricity usage simultaneously.
  Finally, we design a scheduling-based charging station expansion strategy to verify
  our busCharging is also effective during the charging station expansion process.

abstract: Product quality prediction, as an important issue of industrial intelligence,
  is a typical task of industrial process analysis, in which product quality will
  be evaluated and improved as feedback for industrial process adjustment. Data-driven
  methods, with predictive model to analyze various industrial data, have been received
  considerable attention in recent years. However, to get an accurate prediction,
  it is an essential issue to extract quality features from industrial data, including
  several variables generated from supply chain and time-variant machining process.
  In this article, a data-driven method based on wide-deep-sequence (WDS) model is
  proposed to provide a reliable quality prediction for industrial process with different
  types of industrial data. To process industrial data of high redundancy, in this
  article, data reduction is first conducted on different variables by different techniques.
  Also, an improved wide-deep (WD) model is proposed to extract quality features from
  key time-invariant variables. Meanwhile, an long short-term memory (LSTM)-based
  sequence model is presented for exploring quality information from time-domain features.
  Under the joint training strategy, these models will be combined and optimized by
  a designed penalty mechanism for unreliable predictions, especially on reduction
  of defective products. Finally, experiments on a real-world manufacturing process
  data set are carried out to present the effectiveness of the proposed method in
  product quality prediction.

abstract: 'The Essential Climate Variable (ECV) soil moisture (SM) datasets, originated
  from the European Space Agency, have revealed great potential for application in
  hydrology and agriculture. Hence, it is essential to continuously enhance the data
  quality and spatial completeness to satisfy the increasing scientific research requirements.
  In this study, we explore the potential possibility of Soil Moisture Active Passive
  (SMAP) datasets in filling the gaps of ECV SM. The comprehensive assessment results
  show that: (1) The data missing percent of gap-filled ECV decreases 20% on average,
  which can be one step closer to generate a seamlessly covered global land surface
  SM product with favorable quality. (2) Compared to the original ECV, the gap-filled
  ECV products express similar good response to the in-situ measurements, suggesting
  that the SMAP SM products could be taken to efficiently fill the gaps and consistently
  maintain favorable accuracy at the same time. (3) Compared to the in-situ measurements,
  the original ECV SM products demonstrate extremely high probability density peak
  percentages. Fortunately, this eminent high value could be effectively rectified
  through gap-filling progress using SMAP. Overall, this study conducts objective
  and detailed evaluation on the performance of applying SMAP to fill the gaps of
  ECV, and is expected to act as a valuable reference in ECV SM gap-filling method.'

abstract: Climate change mitigation strategies are multifaceted and require collaboration
  among a range of stakeholder groups. The objective of this paper was to develop
  an overarching Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Area Policy (REECAP) framework.
  The framework was developed based on a comprehensive literature review, in which
  seven principles for Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Policies were identified.
  The paper also includes a case study to demonstrate an application of the REECAP
  framework. The novelty of the framework stems from its integration of carbon-energy-cash
  flows among different decision-making spheres, scales and area specific characteristics.
  The framework provides a mathematical understanding of how energy strategies can
  be transformed and optimised in a cost-effective manner by integrating stakeholders
  under a shared vision.

abstract: "Background\nThe Longitudinal Epidemiologic Assessment of Diabetes Risk\
  \ (LEADR) study uses a novel Electronic Health Record (EHR) data approach as a tool\
  \ to assess the epidemiology of known and new risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus\
  \ (T2DM) and study how prevention interventions affect progression to and onset\
  \ of T2DM. We created an electronic cohort of 1.4 million patients having had at\
  \ least 4 encounters with a healthcare organization for at least 24-months; were\
  \ aged \u226518 years in 2010; and had no diabetes (i.e., T1DM or T2DM) at cohort\
  \ entry or in the 12 months following entry. EHR data came from patients at nine\
  \ healthcare organizations across the U.S. between January 1, 2010\u2013December\
  \ 31, 2016.\nResults\nApproximately 5.9% of the LEADR cohort (82,922 patients) developed\
  \ T2DM, providing opportunities to explore longitudinal clinical care, medication\
  \ use, risk factor trajectories, and diagnoses for these patients, compared with\
  \ patients similarly matched prior to disease onset.\nConclusions\nLEADR represents\
  \ one of the largest EHR databases to have repurposed EHR data to examine patients\u2019\
  \ T2DM risk. This paper is first in a series demonstrating this novel approach to\
  \ studying T2DM.\nImplications\nChronic conditions that often take years to develop\
  \ can be studied efficiently using EHR data in a retrospective design.\nLevel of\
  \ evidence\nWhile much is already known about T2DM risk, this EHR's cohort's 160\_\
  M data points for 1.4\_M people over six years, provides opportunities to investigate\
  \ new unique risk factors and evaluate research hypotheses where results could modify\
  \ public health practice for preventing T2DM."

abstract: "Summary\nBackground\nOral rehydration solution (ORS) is a form of oral\
  \ rehydration therapy (ORT) for diarrhoea that has the potential to drastically\
  \ reduce child mortality; yet, according to UNICEF estimates, less than half of\
  \ children younger than 5 years with diarrhoea in low-income and middle-income countries\
  \ (LMICs) received ORS in 2016. A variety of recommended home fluids (RHF) exist\
  \ as alternative forms of ORT; however, it is unclear whether RHF prevent child\
  \ mortality. Previous studies have shown considerable variation between countries\
  \ in ORS and RHF use, but subnational variation is unknown. This study aims to produce\
  \ high-resolution geospatial estimates of relative and absolute coverage of ORS,\
  \ RHF, and ORT (use of either ORS or RHF) in LMICs.\nMethods\nWe used a Bayesian\
  \ geostatistical model including 15 spatial covariates and data from 385 household\
  \ surveys across 94 LMICs to estimate annual proportions of children younger than\
  \ 5 years of age with diarrhoea who received ORS or RHF (or both) on continuous\
  \ continent-wide surfaces in 2000\u201317, and aggregated results to policy-relevant\
  \ administrative units. Additionally, we analysed geographical inequality in coverage\
  \ across administrative units and estimated the number of diarrhoeal deaths averted\
  \ by increased coverage over the study period. Uncertainty in the mean coverage\
  \ estimates was calculated by taking 250 draws from the posterior joint distribution\
  \ of the model and creating uncertainty intervals (UIs) with the 2\xB75th and 97\xB7\
  5th percentiles of those 250 draws.\nFindings\nWhile ORS use among children with\
  \ diarrhoea increased in some countries from 2000 to 2017, coverage remained below\
  \ 50% in the majority (62\xB76%; 12\u2008417 of 19\u2008823) of second administrative-level\
  \ units and an estimated 6\u2008519\u2008000 children (95% UI 5\u2008254\u2008000\u2013\
  7\u2008733\u2008000) with diarrhoea were not treated with any form of ORT in 2017.\
  \ Increases in ORS use corresponded with declines in RHF in many locations, resulting\
  \ in relatively constant overall ORT coverage from 2000 to 2017. Although ORS was\
  \ uniformly distributed subnationally in some countries, within-country geographical\
  \ inequalities persisted in others; 11 countries had at least a 50% difference in\
  \ one of their units compared with the country mean. Increases in ORS use over time\
  \ were correlated with declines in RHF use and in diarrhoeal mortality in many locations,\
  \ and an estimated 52\u2008230 diarrhoeal deaths (36\u2008910\u201368\u2008860)\
  \ were averted by scaling up of ORS coverage between 2000 and 2017. Finally, we\
  \ identified key subnational areas in Colombia, Nigeria, and Sudan as examples of\
  \ where diarrhoeal mortality remains higher than average, while ORS coverage remains\
  \ lower than average.\nInterpretation\nTo our knowledge, this study is the first\
  \ to produce and map subnational estimates of ORS, RHF, and ORT coverage and attributable\
  \ child diarrhoeal deaths across LMICs from 2000 to 2017, allowing for tracking\
  \ progress over time. Our novel results, combined with detailed subnational estimates\
  \ of diarrhoeal morbidity and mortality, can support subnational needs assessments\
  \ aimed at furthering policy makers' understanding of within-country disparities.\
  \ Over 50 years after the discovery that led to this simple, cheap, and life-saving\
  \ therapy, large gains in reducing mortality could still be made by reducing geographical\
  \ inequalities in ORS coverage.\nFunding\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation."

abstract: The number of chemicals with potential to reach the environment is still
  largely unknown, which poses great challenges for both environmental scientists
  and analytical chemists. Liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry
  (LC-HRMS) is currently the instrumentation of choice for identification of wide-scope
  polar chemicals of concern (CECs) in water. This review critically evaluates all
  steps involved in screening for polar CECs in water, including sampling and extraction,
  analysis by LC-HRMS, data (pre-)treatment, evaluation and reporting. Passive samplers
  and direct injection, in combination with LC-HRMS, provide new opportunities compared
  with conventional grab water sampling, as do instrumental advances such as ion-mobility
  spectrometry coupled to HRMS (IM-HRMS). In this paper, we argue that target, suspect
  and non-target screening should not be viewed as three separate principles, but
  rather as conceptual approaches to general data treatment strategies that can be
  linked together. Due to the large amount of data generated, smart prioritisation
  strategies are needed, in particular for non-target screening, to reduce complexity
  and focus on data of high interest. We critically evaluate existing strategies and
  consider that each prioritisation step will result in data loss (as any other step
  in a screening study), requiring compromises depending on the research question
  to be tackled. Many different data treatment strategies have been developed in recent
  years, but structure elucidation remains a challenging and time-consuming task.
  We discuss current and potential future trends, e.g. effect-based methods that can
  be used as future prioritisation tools, technological advances like IM-HRMS and
  improved software solutions that can enable new data treatment strategies.

abstract: "The technical features of blockchain, including decentralization, data\
  \ transparency, tamper-proofing, traceability, privacy protection and open-sourcing,\
  \ make it a suitable technology for solving the information asymmetry problem in\
  \ personal credit reporting transactions. Applying blockchain technology to credit\
  \ reporting meets the needs of social credit system construction and may become\
  \ an important technical direction in the future. This paper analyzed the problems\
  \ faced by China\u2019s personal credit reporting market, designed the framework\

abstract: "Due to the comparatively low frequency of long-distance and overnight travel,\
  \ it can be challenging to measure using traditional travel surveys. In response\
  \ to this dearth of data, several recent surveys have included self-reported frequency\
  \ questions. However, the value and accuracy of these questions is unclear. This\
  \ study leverages data from 628 panel members who completed a year-long, online\
  \ survey in 2013\u20132014 by comparing their one-time self-assessment of typical\
  \ overnight trip frequency to those reported in 12 subsequent monthly surveys. The\
  \ self-assessed frequency of overnight tours, airplane tours and tours to non-North\
  \ American destinations are consistent for only 68% and 70% of respondents for work\
  \ and personal tours respectively. For most tour types, consistency is highest for\
  \ low frequency (never and <1 per year) suggesting, unsurprisingly, that individuals\
  \ are good at knowing they do not travel. Inconsistent estimators both over- and\
  \ under-estimated trip-making suggest that not only is recall an issue but that\
  \ prestige bias and the complexity and variability of long-distance travel are factors\
  \ in recall as well. Few demographic factors were statistically significant in estimating\
  \ whether participants were consistent reporters. Only 9% of participants consistently\
  \ either over- or under-estimated both work and personal trips suggesting that there\
  \ is simply a general inaccuracy in these survey questions for measuring long-distance\
  \ travel. The aggregate trip rate across people and trip types was accurate suggesting\
  \ this crude frequency measure may be acceptable for total frequency but not for\
  \ understanding relative patterns or details in overnight long-distance travel."

abstract: The massive rise of Big Data generated from smartphones, social media, Internet
  of Things (IoT), and multimedia, has produced an overwhelming flow of data in either
  structured or unstructured format. Big Data technologies are being developed and
  implemented in the food supply chain that gather and analyse these data. Such technologies
  demand new approaches in data collection, storage, processing and knowledge extraction.
  In this article, an overview of the recent developments in Big Data applications
  in food safety are presented. This review shows that the use of Big Data in food
  safety remains in its infancy but it is influencing the entire food supply chain.
  Big Data analysis is used to provide predictive insights in several steps in the
  food supply chain, support supply chain actors in taking real time decisions, and
  design the monitoring and sampling strategies. Lastly, the main research challenges
  that require research efforts are introduced.

abstract: "Within CONNECTING Nature, we are dealing with developing innovative nature-based\
  \ solutions (NBS) for climate change adaptation, health and well-being, social cohesion\
  \ and sustainable economic development in European cities. In order to enable \u201C\
  learning by comparing\u201D and \u201Cgenerating new knowledge\u201D from multiple\
  \ NBS related studies, a novel data and knowledge base is needed which requires\
  \ a specified methodological approach for its development. This paper provides conceptual\
  \ and methodological context and techniques for constructing such a data and knowledge\
  \ base that will systematically support the process of NBS monitoring and assessment:\u2022\
  A methodology presents the comprehensive, multi-step approach to the NBS data and\
  \ knowledge development that helps to guide work and influence the quality of an\
  \ information included.\u2022The paper describes the methodology and main steps/phases\
  \ for developing a large data and knowledge base of NBS that will allow further\
  \ systematic review.\u2022The suggested methodology explains how to build NBS related\
  \ databases from the conceptualization and requirements phases through to implementation\
  \ and maintenance. In this regard, such a methodology is iterative, with extensive\
  \ NBS stakeholders\u2019 and end-user's involvement that are packaged with reusable\
  \ templates or deliverables offering a good opportunity for success when used by\
  \ practitioners and other end-users.\u2022The NBS data and knowledge base gathers\
  \ information about different NBS models and generations into one easy-to-find,\
  \ easy-to-use place and provides detailed descriptions of each of the 1490 NBS cases\
  \ from urban centers in Europe.\u2022The data and knowledge base thus helps users\
  \ identify the best and most appropriated NBS model/type for addressing the particular\
  \ goals and, at the same time, considers the local context and potential.\u2022\
  The data obtained can be used for the further meta-analysis by applying statistics\
  \ or searching for specific sample cases and thus enables to generate and expand\
  \ the knowledge from multiple NBS related studies, in both qualitative and quantitative\
  \ ways."

abstract: "Big data analytics and artificial intelligence, paired with blockchain\
  \ technology, the Internet of Things, and other emerging technologies, are poised\
  \ to revolutionise urban management. With massive amounts of data collected from\
  \ citizens, devices, and traditional sources such as routine and well-established\
  \ censuses, urban areas across the world have \u2013 for the first time in history\
  \ \u2013 the opportunity to monitor and manage their urban infrastructure in real-time.\
  \ This simultaneously provides previously unimaginable opportunities to shape the\
  \ future of cities, but also gives rise to new ethical challenges. This paper provides\
  \ a transdisciplinary synthesis of the developments, opportunities, and challenges\
  \ for urban management and planning under this ongoing \u2018digital revolution\u2019\
  \ to provide a reference point for the largely fragmented research efforts and policy\
  \ practice in this area. We consider both top-down systems engineering approaches\
  \ and the bottom-up emergent approaches to coordination of different systems and\
  \ functions, their implications for the existing physical and institutional constraints\
  \ on the built environment and various planning practices, as well as the social\
  \ and ethical considerations associated with this transformation from non-digital\

abstract: The effects of COVID-19 have quickly spread around the world, testing the
  limits of the population and the public health sector. High demand on medical services
  are offset by disruptions in daily operations as hospitals struggle to function
  in the face of overcapacity, understaffing and information gaps. Faced with these
  problems, new technologies are being deployed to fight this pandemic and help medical
  staff governments to reduce its spread. Among these technologies, we find blockchains
  and Big Data which have been used in tracking, prediction applications and others.
  However, despite the help that these new technologies have provided, they remain
  limited if the data with which they are fed are not of good quality. In this paper,
  we highlight some benefits of using BIG Data and Blockchain to deal with this pandemic
  and some data quality issues that still present challenges to decision making. Finally
  we present a general Blockchain-based framework for data governance that aims to
  ensure a high level of data trust, security, and privacy.

abstract: 'Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is a paradigm that exploits the presence of a
  crowd of moving human participants to acquire, or generate, data from their environment.
  As a part of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm, MCS serves the quest for a more
  efficient operation of a smart city. Big data techniques employed on this data produce
  inferences about the participants'' environment, the smart city. However, sufficient
  amounts of data are not always available. Sometimes, the available data are scarce
  as it is obtained at different times, locations, and from different MCS participants
  who may not be present. As a consequence, the scale of data acquired may be small
  and susceptible to errors. In such scenarios, the MCS system requires techniques
  that acquire reliable inferences from such limited data sets. To that end, we resort
  to small data (SD) techniques that are relevant for scarce and erroneous scenarios.
  In this article, we discuss SD and propose schemes to tackle the problems associated
  with such limited data sets, in the context of the smart city. We propose two novel
  quality metrics: 1) MAD quality metric (MAD-Q) and 2) MAD bootstrap quality metric
  (MADBS-Q), to deal with SD, focusing on evaluating the quality of a data set within
  MCS. We also propose an MCS-specific coverage metric that combines the spatial dimension
  with MAD-Q and MADBS-Q. We show the performance of all the presented techniques
  through closed-form mathematical expressions, with which simulation results were
  found to be consistent.'

abstract: The prediction of building energy use is the basis for smart building operation,
  which optimizes building performance through control and low-energy strategy. For
  reducing computation complexity and improving calculation accuracy, a comparative
  study of online electricity data predictions for different types of buildings was
  conducted. This study is also intended to assess the capability and accuracy of
  the supervised machine learning methods, with which the kernel algorithms of predictions
  were developed. Specifically, in this study, large-scale real data collected from
  the building energy management system were used in the online energy consumption
  forecasting, which is specially designed for optimized control, real-time fault
  detection, diagnosis and abnormality alarms. Firstly, the characteristics of building
  energy profiles and data reliability were addressed. Mathematical algorithms were
  introduced and their previous applications in building energy usage prediction were
  summarized, including the evaluation criteria that are effective for energy use
  predictions in buildings. The reliability and efficiency of the proposed algorithms
  were then demonstrated through the comparison between the monitored actual data
  and the predicted results. It is found that Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) can
  give acceptable predictions on the energy consumption of office buildings with an
  equilibrium of data prediction accuracy with the average deviations of below 15%
  and low computation time. Additionally, the statistical evaluation criteria proposed
  by ASHRAE can also be satisfied. For hotels and shopping malls where complex functions
  were applied in these buildings, their accuracy are not better or even the same
  as those of simplified models, due to the significant effects of the factors involving
  occupant's activities and schedules as well as data reliability on building energy
  usage. Our result revealed that GPR is a reliable method and can still generate
  highly accurate predictions when a large data set with a small time interval and
  complex energy use patterns obtained from real building measurements rather than
  simulated data are involved.

abstract: Time series feature extraction is one of the preliminary steps of conventional
  machine learning pipelines. Quite often, this process ends being a time consuming
  and complex task as data scientists must consider a combination between a multitude
  of domain knowledge factors and coding implementation. We present in this paper
  a Python package entitled Time Series Feature Extraction Library (TSFEL), which
  computes over 60 different features extracted across temporal, statistical and spectral
  domains. User customisation is achieved using either an online interface or a conventional
  Python package for more flexibility and integration into real deployment scenarios.
  TSFEL is designed to support the process of fast exploratory data analysis and feature
  extraction on time series with computational cost evaluation.

abstract: "Improving female empowerment is an important human rights and development\
  \ goal that needs better monitoring. A number of indices have been developed to\
  \ track female empowerment at the national level, but these are incomplete and may\
  \ obscure important sub-national variation. We developed the Female Empowerment\
  \ Index (FEMI) to track multiple domains of women's empowerment at the sub-national\
  \ level. The index is based on six categories of empowerment: violence against women,\
  \ employment, education, reproductive healthcare, decision making, and access to\
  \ contraceptives. The FEMI has a range of zero to one (low to high empowerment),\
  \ and it is calculated as the mean proportion of positive outcomes in the six categories.\
  \ To provide a proof of concept, we computed the FEMI for Nigeria and its 36 states\
  \ from five Demographic and Health Surveys between the years of 1990 and 2013, using\
  \ questions asked to 98,542 women between 15 and 49 years old. At the national level,\
  \ the FEMI increased from 0.34 to 0.48. However, there was substantial sub-national\
  \ variation, with state-level values ranging from 0.16-0.60 in 1990 to 0.19\u2013\
  0.73 in 2013. Our findings thus illustrate the importance of considering sub-national\
  \ variation in female empowerment. The FEMI can be readily computed for other countries,\
  \ and its ability to track spatial and temporal variation in woman's empowerment\
  \ across a broad set of categories may make it more useful than existing approaches."

abstract: Recent empirical studies reveal that predictive maintenance is essential
  for accomplishing business objectives of manufacturing enterprises. Knowledge-based
  maintenance strategies for optimal operation of industrial machines and physical
  assets reasonably require explaining and predicting long term economic impacts,
  based on exploring historical data. This paper examines how supervised machine learning
  (ML) techniques may enhance anticipating the economic impact of maintenance on profitability
  (IMP). Planning and monitoring of maintenance activities supported by various statistical
  learning and supervised ML algorithms have been investigated in the literature of
  production management. However, data-driven prediction of IMP has not been largely
  addressed. A novel data-driven framework is proposed comprising cause-and-effect
  dependencies between maintenance and profitability, which constructs a set of appropriate
  features as independent variables.

abstract: 'Supply chain disruptions have serious consequences for society and this
  has made supply chain risk management (SCRM) an attractive area for researchers
  and managers. In this paper, we use an objective literature mapping approach to
  identify, classify, and analyze decision-making models and support systems for SCRM,
  providing an agenda for future research. Through bibliometric networks of articles
  published in the Scopus database, we analyze the most influential decision-making
  models and support systems for SCRM, evaluate the main areas of current research,
  and provide insights for future research in this field. The main results are the
  following: we found that the identity of the area is structured in three groups
  of risk decision support models: (i) quantitative multicriteria decision models,
  (ii) stochastic decision-making models, and (iii) computational simulation/optimization
  models. We mapped six current research clusters: (i) conceptual and qualitative
  risk models, (ii) upstream supply chain risk models, (iii) downstream supply chain
  risk models, (iv) supply chain sustainability risk models, (v) stochastic and multicriteria
  decision risk models, and (vi) emerging techniques risk models. We identified seven
  future research clusters, with insights from further studies for: (i) tools to operate
  SCRM data, (ii) validation of risk models, (iii) computational improvement for data
  analysis, (iv) multi-level and multi-period supply chains, (v) agrifood risks, (vi)
  energy risks and (vii) sustainability risks. Finally, the future research agenda
  should prioritize SCRM''s holistic vision, the relationship between Big Data, Industry
  4.0 and SCRM, as well as emerging social and environmental risks.'

abstract: "Purpose\nThough the domain of big data and artificial intelligence in health\
  \ care continues to evolve, there is a lack of systemic methods to improve data\
  \ quality and streamline the preparation process. To address this, we aimed to develop\
  \ an automated sorting system (RetiSort) that accurately labels the type and laterality\
  \ of retinal photographs.\nDesign\nCross-sectional study.\nParticipants\nRetiSort\
  \ was developed with retinal photographs from the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye\
  \ Diseases (SEED) study.\nMethods\nThe development of RetiSort was composed of 3\
  \ steps: 2 deep-learning (DL) algorithms and 1 rule-based classifier. For step 1,\
  \ a DL algorithm was developed to locate the optic disc, the \u201Clandmark feature.\u201D\
  \ For step 2, based on the location of the optic disc derived from step 1, a rule-based\
  \ classifier was developed to sort retinal photographs into 3 types: macular-centered,\
  \ optic disc\u2013centered, or related to other fields. Step 2 concurrently distinguished\
  \ laterality (i.e., the left or right eye) of macular-centered photographs. For\
  \ step 3, an additional DL algorithm was developed to differentiate the laterality\
  \ of disc-centered photographs. Via the 3 steps, RetiSort sorted and labeled retinal\
  \ images into (1) right macular\u2013centered, (2) left macular\u2013centered, (3)\
  \ right optic disc\u2013centered, (4) left optic disc\u2013centered, and (5) images\
  \ relating to other fields. Subsequently, the accuracy of RetiSort was evaluated\
  \ on 5000 randomly selected retinal images from SEED as well as on 3 publicly available\
  \ image databases (DIARETDB0, HEI-MED, and Drishti-GS). The main outcome measure\
  \ was the accuracy for sorting of retinal photographs.\nResults\nRetiSort mislabeled\
  \ 48 out of 5000 retinal images from SEED, representing an overall accuracy of 99.0%\
  \ (95% confidence interval [CI], 98.7\u201399.3). In external tests, RetiSort mislabeled\
  \ 1, 0, and 2 images, respectively, from DIARETDB0, HEI-MED, and Drishti-GS, representing\
  \ an accuracy of 99.2% (95% CI, 95.8\u201399.9), 100%, and 98.0% (95% CI, 93.1\u2013\
  99.8), respectively. Saliency maps consistently showed that the DL algorithm in\
  \ step 3 required pixels in the central left lateral border and optic disc of optic\
  \ disc\u2013centered retinal photographs to differentiate the laterality.\nConclusions\n\
  RetiSort is a highly accurate automated sorting system. It can aid in data preparation\
  \ and has practical applications in DL research that uses retinal photographs."

abstract: 'Summary

  Drug repurposing or repositioning is a technique whereby existing drugs are used
  to treat emerging and challenging diseases, including COVID-19. Drug repurposing
  has become a promising approach because of the opportunity for reduced development
  timelines and overall costs. In the big data era, artificial intelligence (AI) and
  network medicine offer cutting-edge application of information science to defining
  disease, medicine, therapeutics, and identifying targets with the least error. In
  this Review, we introduce guidelines on how to use AI for accelerating drug repurposing
  or repositioning, for which AI approaches are not just formidable but are also necessary.
  We discuss how to use AI models in precision medicine, and as an example, how AI
  models can accelerate COVID-19 drug repurposing. Rapidly developing, powerful, and
  innovative AI and network medicine technologies can expedite therapeutic development.
  This Review provides a strong rationale for using AI-based assistive tools for drug
  repurposing medications for human disease, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.'

abstract: "Background\nArtificial intelligence (AI) promises to provide useful information\
  \ to clinicians specializing in hypertension. Already, there are some significant\
  \ AI applications on large validated data sets.\nMethods and results\nThis review\
  \ presents the use of AI to predict clinical outcomes in big data i.e. data with\
  \ high volume, variety, veracity, velocity and value. Four examples are included\
  \ in this review. In the first example, deep learning and support vector machine\
  \ (SVM) predicted the occurrence of cardiovascular events with 56%\u201357% accuracy.\
  \ In the second example, in a data base of 378,256 patients, a neural network algorithm\
  \ predicted the occurrence of cardiovascular events during 10 year follow up with\
  \ sensitivity (68%) and specificity (71%). In the third example, a machine learning\
  \ algorithm classified 1,504,437 patients on the presence or absence of hypertension\
  \ with 51% sensitivity, 99% specificity and area under the curve 87%. In example\
  \ four, wearable biosensors and portable devices were used in assessing a person's\
  \ risk of developing hypertension using photoplethysmography to separate persons\
  \ who were at risk of developing hypertension with sensitivity higher than 80% and\
  \ positive predictive value higher than 90%. The results of the above studies were\
  \ adjusted for demographics and the traditional risk factors for atherosclerotic\
  \ disease.\nConclusion\nThese examples describe the use of artificial intelligence\
  \ methods in the field of hypertension."

abstract: "Amid the burgeoning interest in and use of academic and learning analytics\
  \ through learning management systems (LMS), the implications of big data and their\
  \ uses should be central to computers and writing scholarship. In this case study\
  \ we describe the UMN Canvas LMS experience in such as way so that writing instructors\
  \ might become more familiar with levels of access to academic and learning analytics,\
  \ more acquainted with the analytical capabilities in LMSs, and more mindful of\
  \ implications of learning analytics stemming from LMS use in writing pedagogy.\
  \ We provide a historical account on the development and infusion of LMS in writing\
  \ pedagogy and demonstrate how these systems are affecting the way computers and\
  \ composition scholars consider writing instruction and assessment. We then respond\
  \ critically to the collection of data drawn from the authors\u2019 use of these\
  \ systems in on-campus and online teaching. We conclude with implications for writing\
  \ pedagogy along with a matrix for addressing ethical concerns."
